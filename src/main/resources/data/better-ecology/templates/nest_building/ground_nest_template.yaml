  # Preferred nesting blocks (for location selection)

  # Quality thresholds
  quality:
    min_for_breeding: 0.5              # Minimum quality for breeding
    min_for_egg_laying: 0.3            # Minimum quality for egg laying
    excellent: 0.8                     # Quality considered excellent

    # Effects of nest quality
    high_quality_benefits:
      egg_incubation_speed: 1.5        # Faster egg development
      breeding_cooldown_reduction: 0.8 # Lower breeding cooldown
      offspring_health_bonus: 1.2      # Babies start healthier

    low_quality_penalties:
      egg_failure_chance: 0.3          # Chance eggs fail to hatch
      abandonment_chance: 0.2          # Chance to abandon nest
      offspring_health_penalty: 0.8    # Babies start weaker

  # Disturbance handling
  disturbance:
    max_disturbances: 5                # Maximum disturbances before abandonment
    cooldown_after_disturbance: 600    # Ticks before using nest again
    recovery_rate: 0.01                # How fast disturbance count decreases

  # Seasonal adjustments
  seasonal:
    spring_activity: 1.5               # Increased nest building in spring
    winter_activity: 0.5               # Reduced nest building in winter
    winter_maintenance: true           # Perform maintenance in winter
