          When a strider is on land and outside of lava, it becomes cold
          and uncomfortable. The strider should actively seek out and return
          to the nearest lava source within 16 blocks. The strider moves
          slowly and shivers while cold, showing visual distress (purple color,
          frowning expression). Once in lava, the strider returns to normal

unique_behaviors:
  - name: "lava_walking"
    description: |
      Striders can walk on lava surfaces without sinking or taking damage.
      They treat lava as solid ground, moving freely across lava oceans.

      WHEN: Always active when strider is alive
      WHERE: On any lava block surface
      WHAT: Strider walks on top of lava with full movement capability.
      If spawned under lava, automatically rises to surface.
      Completely immune to lava damage.
      WHY: Primary adaptation allowing striders to inhabit Nether lava oceans

  - name: "temperature_based_physiology"
    description: |
      Striders undergo dramatic physiological changes based on environmental
      temperature (lava contact). This is a core survival mechanic that
      affects appearance, movement, and behavior.

      WHEN: When strider transitions between lava and non-lava blocks
      WHERE: Anywhere - state persists based on current block
      WHAT: When in lava: red-orange color, normal expression, full leg
      extension, 1.8x movement speed, active behavior.
      When out of lava: purple-burgundy color, frowning expression,
      shortened legs, shivering animation, 0.5x movement speed.
      WHY: Biological requirement for extreme heat - shows Nether adaptation

  - name: "water_rain_vulnerability"
    description: |
      Striders take damage from water, rain, and splash water bottles.
      This is unusual because damage applies even while in lava during rain.

      WHEN: When in contact with water blocks or during rain weather
      WHERE: Anywhere - even in lava during rain
      WHAT: Takes 1 HP damage per splash water bottle or per 0.5 seconds
      of rain/water exposure. Slowly sinks in water while taking damage.
      Should seek shelter when raining in Overworld.
      WHY: Creates environmental weakness balancing their lava immunity

      duration: null
      affects_others: false
      world_modification: false

  - name: "saddleable_mount_with_control"
    description: |
      Striders can be saddled and ridden like horses, but require warped
      fungus on a stick for control and can boost speed temporarily.

      WHEN: When player right-clicks with saddle, then mounts with empty hand
      WHERE: Anywhere strider exists
      WHAT: Player can saddle strider (removable with shears). When mounted,
      strider moves forward automatically. Player uses warped fungus on
      a stick to control direction. Using the control activates a speed
      boost (2.2x speed) for 7-49 seconds at cost of 1 durability.
      Control item reverts to fishing rod at 0 durability.
      WHY: Provides unique transportation method across Nether lava oceans

  - name: "attraction_to_warped_fungus"
    description: |
      Striders are attracted to players holding warped fungus or warped
      fungus on a stick, allowing players to lead and corral them.

      WHEN: When player holds warped fungus or warped fungus on a stick
      WHERE: Within strider's line of sight
      WHAT: Strider stops current behavior and pathfinds toward player,
      following them as long as item is held. Used for leading striders
      to desired locations, setting up breeding pairs, or bringing them
      back to lava.
      WHY: Enables breeding management and transportation setup

      affects_others: false
      world_modification: false

  - name: "baby_strider_jockey_behavior"
    description: |
      Baby striders naturally ride on adult striders. 10% of spawned
      striders have a baby riding on top.

      WHEN: On spawn (10% chance) or when baby strider is near adult
      WHERE: Any lava surface with adult strider
      WHAT: Baby strider positions itself on top of adult strider.
      Adult is NEVER saddled when carrying baby. Baby can grow to
      adulthood while riding. Once grown, can be ridden by player.
      Only one baby per adult at a time.
      WHY: Natural transport/protection behavior for offspring

    implementation_hints:

      priority: 6
      duration: null
      affects_others: true

  - name: "zombified_piglin_jockey_host"
    description: |
      Striders can spawn with zombified piglins riding them as jockeys.
      This creates a hostile/neutral mob combination.

      WHEN: On spawn (3.33% chance)
      WHERE: Nether lava oceans
      WHAT: Zombified piglin (baby or adult) spawns riding strider.
      Strider spawns WITH saddle equipped. Piglin holds warped fungus
      on stick instead of golden sword. Initially neutral toward players.
      If attacked or rider angered, becomes hostile and attacks via melee.
      Piglin CANNOT use fungus stick for speed boost. If rider killed,
      strider becomes passive and can be immediately ridden by player.
      Saddle cannot be removed with shears while piglin is riding.
      WHY: Creates unique Nether mob variant, adds danger to lava travel

# [UNIQUE] NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
# ============================================================================
# Free-form description for AI to understand this mob's "character"
# ============================================================================

narrative:
  summary: |
    The Strider is the only passive mob native to the Nether, uniquely
    adapted to traverse lava oceans as surface-dwelling creatures. They
    serve as the primary transportation method across the Nether's
    hazardous lava seas, filling the ecological niche of a lava-walking
    herbivore that feeds exclusively on warped fungus.

  behavior_overview: |
    Striders spend their lives wandering on lava surfaces in Nether biomes,
    showing remarkable comfort on molten rock but becoming distressed when
    forced onto land. Outside of lava, they turn purple, shiver, and move
    painfully slow, actively seeking to return to the heat. They're peaceful
    creatures that flee when attacked but never retaliate. Striders live
    solitary lives, though babies may be seen riding on adults. They're
    attracted to players holding warped fungus, making them easy to lead
    and breed. Their most notable feature is their ability to be saddled
    and ridden, with players using warped fungus on a stick to steer them
    across lava oceans at impressive speeds.

  ecological_importance: |
    As the Nether's only passive mob, striders occupy a unique position in
    the ecosystem. They're primary consumers that depend on warped fungus
    from Warped Forest biomes, creating a biological connection between
    different Nether regions. Without striders, players would have no
    renewable source of string in the Nether and would struggle to cross
    lava oceans safely. Their ability to be ridden provides crucial
    transportation infrastructure in the otherwise impassable Nether
    terrain. While they have no natural predators, they serve as hosts for
    zombified piglin jockeys, creating an interesting symbiotic/parasitic
    relationship. If removed, the Nether would lose its sole docile creature
    and players would lose the most efficient method of lava travel.

  design_notes: |
    Striders are fundamentally temperature-dependent creatures. All systems
    should prioritize their heat requirements - they thrive in lava and
    suffer without it. The shivering/purple state isn't just cosmetic;
    it represents severe performance degradation that should trigger
    pathfinding back to lava. Water and rain are existential threats that
    cause active fleeing and shelter-seeking behavior.

    The riding mechanics need careful implementation: saddling works like
    horses, but the warped fungus on a stick control system is unique.
    Speed boosts should feel rewarding but consume durability meaningfully.
    The automatic forward movement with directional influence is different
    from other mounts.

    Baby-on-adult spawning happens naturally, but adults should NEVER spawn
    saddled when carrying babies. Zombified piglin jockeys should spawn
    WITH saddles and create genuinely threatening encounters that transform
    into rideable opportunities once the rider is defeated.

    Importantly: early development had striders die when cold. This was
    removed as "too sad." The current version shows distress without death,
    which creates emergent compassionate gameplay - players voluntarily
    build lava pools to keep striders warm. The systems should support this
    emotional connection.
