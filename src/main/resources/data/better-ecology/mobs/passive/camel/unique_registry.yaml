# [UNIQUE] SPECIAL BEHAVIORS
# ============================================================================
# These are the signature behaviors that make camels unique in Minecraft
# ============================================================================

unique_behaviors:
  - name: "dash_sprint_ability"
    description: |
      Camel can perform a charged dash that launches up to 12 blocks forward
      and 1 block upward. This is activated by holding the jump control while
      riding, with the experience bar showing dash charge level.

      WHEN: Player holds jump control while riding saddled camel
      WHERE: Anywhere while mounted
      WHAT: Camel charges forward rapidly, covering up to 12 blocks distance
           with 1 block of vertical gain. Cooldown of 2.75 seconds (55 ticks)
           between dashes. Camel cannot sprint briefly after dashing.
      WHY: Provides fast desert traversal and escape capability

    implementation_hints:
      trigger_type: "PLAYER_INPUT"
      priority: 5
      duration: 15               # Dash duration in ticks
      affects_others: false
      world_modification: false

  - name: "two_player_mount_system"
    description: |
      Camels are the only mob that naturally support two simultaneous riders.
      The first player to mount gets the front seat and has full control.
      The second rider is a passenger and cannot interfere with control.

      WHEN: Players attempt to mount a saddled camel
      WHERE: Anywhere
      WHAT: First rider sits in front seat with full movement control.
           Second rider sits in back seat as passenger. If front rider
           dismounts, passenger takes control automatically.
           Second rider cannot damage front rider or camel.
      WHY: Unique cooperative transport for desert exploration

    implementation_hints:
      trigger_type: "EVENT"
      priority: 3
      duration: null
      affects_others: true       # Second player
      world_modification: false

  - name: "sitting_idle_animation"
    description: |
      Camels periodically sit down for 2-7 seconds with a detailed resting
      animation. While sitting, they cannot be pushed by players or mobs.

      WHEN: Random intervals when camel is idle and not being ridden
      WHERE: Anywhere on solid ground
      WHAT: Camel transitions to sitting state (height reduces to 0.945 blocks).
           Remains seated for 40-140 ticks (2-7 seconds) before standing.
           Cannot be pushed, moved, or mounted while sitting.
           Instantly stands when harmed or detects cactus-holding player nearby.
           Will not stand up if blocks are directly above.
      WHY: Adds personality and visual variety to passive behavior

    implementation_hints:
      trigger_type: "RANDOM"
      priority: 10
      duration: [40, 140]        # 2-7 seconds in ticks
      affects_others: false
      world_modification: false

  - name: "tall_mount_advantage"
    description: |
      The camel's height (2.375 blocks) provides passive protection to riders
      from ground-based melee hostile mobs. Riders are positioned too high
      to be reached by most melee attacks.

      WHEN: Player is riding camel
      WHERE: Anywhere
      WHAT: Riders are elevated such that ground-based hostile mobs with
           melee attacks cannot reach them. This includes zombies, husks,
           skeletons (melee), spiders, slimes, etc. Only ranged or flying
           mobs can attack mounted players.
      WHY: Gameplay advantage encouraging camel use in dangerous areas

  - name: "enhanced_step_height"
    description: |
      Camels can automatically step up 1.5 blocks without jumping, compared
      to the 1-block step height of other mounts. This allows traversing
      fences, walls, and other terrain obstacles.

      WHEN: Camel encounters obstacle up to 1.5 blocks high while moving
      WHERE: Anywhere during movement
      WHAT: Camel automatically steps up blocks up to 1.5 blocks high
           without requiring jump input. Can surmount fences, walls,
           and other barriers that stop horses, donkeys, and mules.
      WHY: Superior terrain navigation for desert exploration

  - name: "cactus_following_behavior"
    description: |
      Camels follow players holding cactus but will stop following if
      separated beyond a certain distance. They will immediately stand
      up from sitting when cactus is detected.

      WHEN: Player holds cactus within detection range
      WHERE: Within 10 blocks (Java) or 16 blocks (Bedrock)
      WHAT: Camel follows player holding cactus. Stops following if
           distance exceeds threshold. If camel is sitting, immediately
           stands up and approaches when cactus detected.
      WHY: Standard breeding/leading mechanic for cactus-only diet

      Camels take reduced fall damage compared to other mobs, reflecting
      their real-world desert adaptations.

      WHEN: Camel takes fall damage
      WHERE: Anywhere
      WHAT: Safe fall distance of 6 blocks (vs 3 for most mobs).
           Takes 50% of normal fall damage (rounded up).
      WHY: Realistic adaptation to desert terrain and height

      They stand up instantly when hurt.

      WHEN: Camel takes damage from any source
      WHERE: Anywhere, even while sitting
      WHAT: Immediately transitions from sitting to standing (if seated)
           and flees from threat at increased speed for 48 blocks.
      WHY: Passive mob survival behavior

      Camels are naturally tame and require no taming process. They can
      always be ridden once saddled, with no trust progression needed.

      WHEN: Player attempts to interact with camel
      WHERE: Anywhere
      WHAT: Camel has neutral-to-positive attitude toward players by default.
           No taming items, experience, or progression required.

# ============================================================================
# [UNIQUE] NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
# ============================================================================
narrative:
  summary: |
    The Camel is a large desert-adapted herbivore that serves as the premier
    mount for desert exploration in Minecraft. Based on the real-world
    dromedary camel, it combines passive temperament with unique mobility
    advantages including a dash ability, two-rider capacity, and enhanced
    step height for traversing difficult terrain.

  behavior_overview: |
    Camels are solitary, passive animals that spend most of their time
    wandering desert terrain and grazing exclusively on cacti. They exhibit
    a distinctive sitting behavior, resting for 2-7 seconds at random intervals
    with a fully visible resting animation. Despite being specialized for
    desert life, they paradoxically take damage from cactus blocks while
    feeding on them - a quirk of their implementation. When harmed, they
    immediately flee, even rising instantly from their seated position.

    Camels are unique among mounts for their naturally tame disposition -
    they require no taming process and can be ridden immediately once saddled.
    Their signature dash ability allows rapid traversal of up to 12 blocks
    forward, with a 2.75-second cooldown between uses. Perhaps most notably,
    they naturally support two simultaneous riders - a feature no other mob
    possesses - making them ideal for cooperative desert exploration.

  ecological_importance: |
    In the vanilla ecosystem, camels serve as the primary large herbivore of
    desert biomes, though their spawning is limited to one per desert village
    during world generation. They fill the niche of desert transport animal,
    providing players with safe passage through hostile terrain - riders are
    elevated beyond the reach of most ground-based hostile mobs. Their exclusive
    cactus diet creates a simple food chain dynamic where they serve as prey
    for husks and wolves, while their low spawn rate and solitary nature prevent
    overgrazing of desert vegetation.

    From a gameplay perspective, camels fill an important role as the only
    mount that can carry two players simultaneously, enabling shared adventures
    in dangerous environments. Their enhanced step height and dash ability provide
    traversal advantages no other mount can match, making them the superior choice
    for desert exploration despite their lack of cargo storage.

  design_notes: |
    CAMEL-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

    1. SPACING RARITY: The one-per-village spawn rate makes camels quite rare.
       Consider whether this mod should increase spawning or maintain vanilla
       scarcity for balance reasons.

    2. CACTUS PARADOX: Camels eat cactus but take damage from touching cactus
       blocks. This is vanilla behavior but seems counterintuitive. Consider
       whether to preserve this quirk or add cactus immunity.

    3. NO STORAGE: Unlike llamas, donkeys, and mules, camels cannot equip
       chests. Their two-rider capacity compensates for this (2x player
       inventory), but consider whether saddlebag storage should be added
       as a mod feature.

    4. HEIGHT ADVANTAGE: The 2.375-block height prevents most melee mob attacks
       on riders. This is significant - verify that hostile mob AI properly
       cannot reach elevated riders, or this protection is meaningless.

    5. STEP HEIGHT: 1.5 blocks allows surmounting fences and walls. Ensure this
       doesn't make players effectively invulnerable in enclosed areas -
       they should still need to break some barriers.

    6. SITTING ANIMATION: The 2-7 second sitting duration is purely cosmetic
       but provides character. Don't make sitting camels immobile for too long
       or players may find it annoying when trying to mount.

    7. BABY GROWTH: 20 minutes is substantial but cactus acceleration (-10s
       per feeding) provides player agency. This balance feels appropriate.

    8. DESERT ONLY: Camels spawn only in desert biomes. If adding spawn
       variations (wandering traders, rare desert spawns), maintain the
       thematic connection to desert environments.

    9. SOCIAL BEHAVIOR: Real dromedaries are social herd animals, but Minecraft
       camels spawn solitary. Consider adding herd behavior as a mod feature
       for greater ecological realism.

    10. BREEDING SCARCITY: Players must find multiple desert villages to obtain
        breeding pairs. This creates gameplay incentive for exploration but
        may frustrate some players. Consider alternative acquisition methods.
