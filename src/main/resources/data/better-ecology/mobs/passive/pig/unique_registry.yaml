# ============================================================================

unique_behaviors:
  - name: "saddle_riding_system"
    description: |
      Pigs are the first rideable mob in Minecraft. When equipped with a saddle,
      players can mount and control the pig's movement.

      WHEN: Player right-clicks a saddled pig or uses a saddle on an unsaddled pig
      WHERE: Anywhere the pig exists
      WHAT:
        - Equipping saddle makes pig permanently rideable (until removed with shears)
        - Mounting causes player to sit on pig's back in third-person view
        - Mounted pig moves at base speed of 2.42 m/s (0.25 blocks/tick)
        - Player can see from pig's perspective with slight downward offset
        - Mounting does not override pig's AI - pig still avoids hazards
        - Can ride through 1-block-high spaces (unlike player walking)
        - Can cross 1-block-deep water without dismounting
        - Deeper water (2+ blocks) forces immediate dismount
        - Pig does not float or swim while mounted - sinks in water/lava
        - Fall damage applies to pig, not player (pig has 10 HP)
        - Taking fall damage does not cause knockback or speed reduction

      WHY: Provides early-game transportation before horses are available.
           Historically significant as Minecraft's first mountable mob.

      trigger_type: "EVENT"
      priority: 5
      duration: null
      affects_others: true
      world_modification: false

  - name: "carrot_on_stick_control"
    description: |
      Carrot on a stick provides directional control and temporary speed boost
      while riding pigs.

      WHEN: Player is mounted on pig and holding carrot on a stick
      WHERE: Anywhere while mounted
      WHAT:
        - Base behavior: Pig moves in direction player is facing (or holding carrot)
        - Player controls direction by looking/moving mouse
        - Pig continuously moves forward in player's looking direction
        - Speed boost: Right-click/press use key while mounted
          - Speed increases from 2.42 m/s to maximum 5.20 m/s
          - Speed ramps up gradually (not instant)
          - Boost duration: randomly chosen between 140-980 ticks (7-49 seconds)
          - At end of boost, speed gradually returns to base
          - Each boost costs 7 durability from carrot on stick
          - Carrot on stick has 25 durability maximum
          - Maximum ~3 full boosts before tool breaks
          - When durability reaches 0, converts to fishing rod
          - Player must recraft carrot on stick to continue control

      WHY: Provides incentive-based control system. The carrot represents
           positive reinforcement training. Limited durability creates
           resource cost for mounted transportation.

      world_modification: false

  - name: "lightning_transformation"
    description: |
      When struck by lightning, pigs transform into zombified piglins.
      This is the only non-piglin mob that can become a piglin variant.

      WHEN: Lightning strikes within 4 blocks of pig
      WHERE: Anywhere during thunderstorm or via Channeling trident
      WHAT:
        - Lightning strikes pig (or nearby block within 4-block radius)
        - Immediate transformation:
          - Adult pig -> Adult Zombified Piglin
          - Baby pig -> Baby Zombified Piglin (rare variant)
        - Visual transformation with lightning flash effect
        - Zombified piglin is neutral toward player (unless attacked)
        - Zombified piglin retains no memory of previous pig state
        - Any equipped saddle is dropped as item
        - If player was riding, immediate dismount occurs
        - Player is not damaged by transformation lightning
        - Lightning may start fires in surrounding area (standard lightning behavior)
        - Golden sword is equipped (zombified piglin default equipment)

      WHY: Creates connection between overworld passive mobs and nether mobs.
           Provides unexpected danger/thunderstorm consequence.
           Players can intentionally use Channeling trident to farm zombified piglins.

  - name: "piglin_breeding_interaction"
    description: |
      Piglins can breed pigs, representing their unique relationship with this mob.
      This is the only case where a hostile/neutral mob breeds passive mobs.

      WHEN: Adult piglin holding breeding food (carrot/potato/beetroot) encounters pig
      WHERE: In Nether fortresses, bastion remnants, or anywhere piglins and pigs meet
      WHAT:
        - Adult piglins can feed pigs breeding foods when naturally available
        - Breeding food must be in piglin's hand (picked up from player drops or chests)
        - When fed, pig enters love mode (heart particles)
        - Piglin may feed multiple pigs, attempting to breed them
        - Baby pigs born from piglin-breeding have normal pig behavior
        - This behavior is rare in vanilla due to food scarcity in Nether
        - Cross-dimensional breeding demonstrates piglin's cultural connection to pigs

      WHY: Establishes ecological connection between piglins and pigs.
           Reflects piglin civilization's domestication of pigs.
           Adds depth to Nether ecosystem - piglins aren't just fighters.

  - name: "variant_visual_inheritance"
    description: |
      Pigs have three biome variants (Warm, Cold, Temperate) with purely
      cosmetic differences. Variant inheritance follows specific rules.

      WHEN: Baby pig is born through breeding
      WHERE: Anywhere pig breeding occurs
      WHAT:
        - Three variant types:
          1. Warm Pig (rusty brown, dark brown ears/nose/legs)
             Spawns in: Savanna, Jungle, Badlands
          2. Cold Pig (furry beige texture, brown nose/feet)
             Spawns in: Taiga variants, Windswept hills
          3. Temperate Pig (classic pink)
             Spawns in: All other grassy biomes (default)

        - Breeding mechanics:
          - Baby variant randomly inherited from ONE parent (not current biome)
          - 50% chance from parent A, 50% chance from parent B
          - Biome where baby is born does NOT affect variant
          - Spawn eggs always produce Temperate (default) variant
          - Variants are purely cosmetic - no stat differences
          - Lightning transformation preserves variant visually in zombified piglin

      WHY: Adds visual diversity to Minecraft world. Reflects real-world
           animal adaptation to climates. Provides collectibility for players.

# ============================================================================
# Free-form description for AI to understand this mob's "character"
# ============================================================================

narrative:
  summary: |
    The pig is Minecraft's original farm animal and first rideable mob. These passive,
    pink creatures roam grassy biomes in small groups, serving as a reliable early-game
    food source. With three climate-adapted variants and a unique lightning transformation,
    pigs occupy a special place in both gameplay and Minecraft history.

  behavior_overview: |
    Pigs are simple, peaceful animals that spend their days wandering through grasslands,
    snuffling at the ground in search of food. They form loose herds without complex
    social hierarchy - more like a gathering of individuals than a coordinated group.
    When harmed, they flee briefly but never retaliate, embodying true passivity.

    Their most famous behavior is mountability. Pigs were the very first mob players
    could ride, long before horses were added to the game. This requires a saddle (a
    rare dungeon/chest find) and a carrot on a stick for control. The riding experience
    is quirky - pigs don't have the speed or grace of horses, but they can squeeze
    through one-block gaps and cross shallow water. The carrot on a stick's limited
    durability creates a charming resource-management mechanic where your steering wheel
    literally withers away.

    Pigs have a hidden connection to thunderstorms. When lightning strikes, they undergo
    a dramatic transformation into zombified piglins - gold sword-wielding neutral mobs
    from the Nether. This creates sudden, unexpected danger during storms and provides
    creative players a way to farm zombified piglins using Channeling tridents.

    Three variants - Warm, Cold, and Temperate - show environmental adaptation without
    gameplay differences. A baby born in a snowy taiga might inherit its parent's
    warm savanna colors, carrying genetic memory across biomes.

  ecological_importance: |
    Pigs are a foundational food source in Minecraft's early game. They convert
    abundant plant matter (carrots, potatoes, beetroots) into portable, high-value
    protein (porkchops). This makes them crucial for player survival and establishment
    of sustainable food production.

    Their relationship with piglins reveals Nether ecosystem depth. The fact that
    piglins breed pigs (and hoglins) suggests a culture of domestication paralleling
    human-animal relationships. When pigs transform via lightning, they become piglins'
    undead counterparts - an eerie bridge between dimensions.

    As the first rideable mob, pigs enabled exploration before horses existed. They
    represent Minecraft's evolution - a simple, sometimes awkward mechanic that paved
    the way for more complex systems. Removing pigs would lose this historical connection
    and reduce early-game transportation options for new players.

  design_notes: |
    IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
    1. Lightning transformation is the most unique behavior - must work perfectly
       with proper saddle dropping and player dismounting
    2. Carrot on stick control needs smooth steering and predictable boost mechanics
    3. Variant inheritance should be clear to players (maybe visual indicator in breeding)

    EDGE CASES TO HANDLE:
    - Pig struck by lightning while player is riding -> dismount immediately, don't
      damage player with transformation lightning
    - Carrot on stick breaks at 0 durability -> convert to fishing rod, player falls
      off but can still remount (pig keeps saddle)
    - Pig ridden into deep water -> forced dismount, pig sinks (drowning possible)
    - Pig struck by lightning in Nether (impossible naturally, but via commands?) ->
      should still work, creating zombified piglin in Nether
    - Baby pigs from lightning -> very rare but valid, should be baby zombified piglin

    BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Pigs are intentionally slower than horses (2.42 m/s vs ~10 m/s) - this is
      historical design, not a bug
    - Carrot on stick limited durability (25 uses = ~3 boosts) creates meaningful
      resource cost for mounted transport
    - 10 HP is low for a mount - pig riding is riskier than horse riding
    - No natural predators means pig populations can grow unchecked unless culled by players

    EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES:
    - Could add actual "rooting" behavior (converting grass to dirt, finding items)
    - Mud wallowing for cooling (especially with 1.19+ mud blocks)
    - Temperature discomfort for variants in wrong biome (warm pigs shivering in snow)
    - Piglin breeding behavior could be expanded for Nether ecosystem depth
