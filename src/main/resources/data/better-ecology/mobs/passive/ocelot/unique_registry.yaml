unique_behaviors:
  - name: "trust_based_approach"
    description: |
      Ocelots have a unique trust mechanic where they approach players holding fish
      but flee if the player moves too quickly or looks around abruptly.

      WHEN: Player holds raw cod or salmon within 10 blocks
      WHERE: Any location, during any time
      WHAT: Ocelot enters "begging mode" and slowly approaches player within 6 blocks.
           Will flee if player moves quickly, turns head abruptly within 6 blocks,
           or stops holding fish. Won't re-enter begging mode for 15 seconds after fleeing.
      WHY: Creates cautious, realistic taming mechanic that rewards patient behavior

  - name: "sneak_attack_pounce"
    description: |
      Ocelots stalk prey before attacking with a sudden pounce from a distance.

      WHEN: Hunting chicken or baby turtle, prey detected within 15 blocks
      WHERE: Any jungle biome
      WHAT: Ocelot enters sneaking mode and stalks prey until within 4 blocks,
           then sprints to attack. Can kill prey through fences, fence gates,
           or doors if prey is pressed against them.
      WHY: Realistic feline hunting behavior, creates engaging predator-prey interactions

    description: |
      Ocelots are immune to fall damage but still actively avoid falling.

      WHEN: Any fall occurs
      WHERE: Any location
      WHAT: Ocelot takes no fall damage regardless of height. Pathfinding AI
           still treats falls as undesirable and avoids cliffs when possible.
      WHY: Represents feline agility while maintaining sensible pathfinding

    implementation_hints:
      trigger_type: "EVENT"
      priority: 15
      duration: null
      affects_others: false
      world_modification: false

  - name: "sprinting_ability"
    description: |
      Ocelots can sprint, making them one of the few mobs with this ability.

      WHEN: Fleeing from player or chasing prey
      WHERE: Any location
      WHAT: Ocelot moves at 1.8x normal speed when fleeing or hunting.
           Sprinting consumes energy and cannot be sustained indefinitely.
      WHY: Makes ocelots elusive and difficult to catch, enhances hunting capability

relationships:
  predators: []

  prey:
    - entity: "minecraft:chicken"
      notes: "Primary prey, hunted via stalk-and-pounce method"

    - entity: "minecraft:turtle"

  special:
    - entity: "minecraft:creeper"
      relationship: "FEAR_INDUCTION"
      description: |
        Creepers actively avoid ocelots, maintaining a minimum distance of 6 blocks.
        This is a one-sided relationship - ocelots are indifferent to creepers.
        Creepers already in detonation sequence won't flee unless player leaves
        blast radius. This makes ocelots effective defensive animals around structures.

    - entity: "minecraft:phantom"
      relationship: "FEAR_INDUCTION"
      description: |
        In Bedrock Edition, phantoms stay 16 blocks away from ocelots.
        Java Edition does not have this mechanic. Consider implementing as an
        optional feature for consistency across platforms.


# ============================================================================
# [UNIQUE] NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
# ============================================================================
# Free-form description for AI to understand this mob's "character"
# ============================================================================

narrative:
  summary: |
    The ocelot is a shy, elusive jungle feline that occupies a unique niche as
    both a predator of small animals and a deterrent to creepers. Unlike domestic
    cats, ocelots cannot be truly tamed - only trusted, remaining independent
    wild hunters that tolerate human presence.

  behavior_overview: |
    Ocelots are crepuscular hunters most active at dawn and dusk, spending much
    of the day resting in dense jungle vegetation. They are solitary creatures,
    operating alone except during brief breeding encounters. When hunting, they
    display remarkable patience, stalking prey like chickens and baby turtles
    with slow, deliberate movements before closing the distance with a sudden
    burst of speed. Their hunting prowess is enhanced by their ability to sprint
    and immunity to fall damage, allowing them to navigate the vertical jungle
    terrain with ease.

    Their relationship with players is complex. Wild ocelots are extremely wary,
    fleeing from any sudden movement or direct eye contact within 6 blocks.
    However, they can be cautiously approached by players holding raw cod or
    salmon. If the player remains still and patient, the ocelot may overcome its
    fear enough to accept the food, gradually building trust through repeated
    feedings. Even trusting ocelots remain independent - they do not follow
    commands, sit on request, or teleport to players like tamed cats.

    Perhaps their most unique ecological role is as a creeper deterrent. Creepers
    instinctively fear ocelots and maintain a 6-block distance, making trusting
    ocelots valuable guardians around player structures. This relationship is
    entirely one-sided; ocelots are completely indifferent to creepers.

  ecological_importance: |
    As the primary predator of chickens and baby turtles in jungle biomes,
    ocelots help control populations that might otherwise grow unchecked.
    Their removal would lead to overpopulation of these prey species, which
    could negatively impact vegetation and other wildlife. Their role as
    creeper deterrents, while not ecologically "natural," provides an important
    gameplay function that encourages players to protect and breed them.

    Ocelots occupy the middle tier of the jungle food web - predators to small
    animals, but prey themselves to larger predators (though Minecraft has no
    natural ocelot predators in vanilla). Their hunting success rate of 0.9
    prey per kilometer in the real world suggests they are highly efficient
    hunters, a trait reflected in their Minecraft counterpart's 45% base
    hunting success rate with significant bonuses for weak, isolated, or young
    prey.

  design_notes: |
    Critical distinction: Ocelots are NOT tameable like cats. They can only gain
    trust, which stops them from fleeing but grants no control. Trusting ocelots
    still wander independently and must be confined with leads or enclosures.
    In Java Edition, they can still despawn unless named or placed in a boat -
    this is intentional and reflects their wild nature.

    The trust mechanic should feel earned - only 33% chance per fish, with a
    15-second cooldown if the ocelot flees. Players must be patient and still,
    rewarding careful, slow movements over rushing.

    When implementing the creeper fear mechanic, ensure the flee distance is
    checked before the creeper's explosion priming. Once a creeper starts
    detonating, it should not interrupt the sequence unless the player leaves
    the blast radius.

    The stalking behavior should involve a visible state change to sneaking
    when prey is detected, creating tension before the pounce. The ability to
    attack through fences is a unique feature that should be preserved as it
    reflects ocelots' ability to swipe prey through barriers.

    Baby ocelots spawning with adults (5% chance) and the rare occurrence of
    two babies spawning together adds important variety to natural spawning.
