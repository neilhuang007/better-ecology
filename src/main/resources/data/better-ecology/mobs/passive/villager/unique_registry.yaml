    description: |
      Villagers can claim one of 15 professions by interacting with
      specific job site blocks. Once employed, they gain unique trades

      Armorer, Butcher, Cartographer, Cleric, Farmer, Fisherman,
      Fletcher, Leatherworker, Librarian, Mason, Shepherd, Toolsmith,
      Weaponsmith. Nitwits cannot gain professions.

  - name: "restocking_trades"
    description: |
      Villager trades have limited uses before restocking needed. Villagers
      can restock each trade up to twice per day by working at their job
      site during work hours. Restocking refreshes trade uses, allowing
      more trading. Some trades may be permanently locked after trades.

      WHEN: During work hours at job site
      WHERE: At claimed job site block
      WHAT: Check if restocks available (max 2 per day),
           work at job site for specified duration,
           refresh trade use counts for locked trades
      WHY: Prevents infinite trading without limits,
           creates rhythm to trading economy

    description: |
      Villagers periodically stop and face each other for 4-5 seconds
      to "socialize." During this time, they exchange gossip about
      players, share information, and stare at each other. Occurs
      most frequently during gathering time at the bell. Critical
      for gossip system to spread reputation information.

      WHEN: Two villagers in proximity during gathering or free time
      WHERE: Any location, most common at village bell
      WHAT: Stop movement, face each other, emit socialize particles,
           exchange gossip data, resume normal behavior after 4-5 seconds
      WHY: Spreads gossip, creates village atmosphere,
           enables reputation system to work

# ============================================================================
# [UNIQUE] NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
# ============================================================================
narrative:
  summary: |
    Villagers are civilized, sedentary humanoids that form the foundation of
    Minecraft's only organized society. They live in villages, practice
    agriculture, develop specialized professions, and conduct trade using
    emeralds as currency. Unlike wild creatures, villagers follow structured
    daily schedules, maintain social relationships through gossip, and build
    defensive alliances with iron golems.

  behavior_overview: |
    A typical villager's day revolves around their profession and village
    schedule. At dawn, employed villagers head to their job sites - farmers
    tend crops, librarians study at lecterns, armorers work at blast furnaces.
    In late morning, the entire village gathers at the bell to socialize and
    exchange gossip. Afternoon brings more work or free time for wandering.
    As evening approaches, villagers return to their claimed beds and sleep
    through the night, protected from the dangers of the outside world.

    Farmers are uniquely productive, automatically harvesting and replanting
    crops within range. They share excess food with other villagers, enabling
    autonomous village breeding. When threats appear, villagers flee indoors
    and can summon iron golems for defense. Their gossip system means they
    remember player actions - helpful players get better trade prices, while
    aggressors face higher costs and potentially hostile iron golems.

  ecological_importance: |
    Villagers are unique in Minecraft as the only mob that represents
    civilization and organized society. Their removal would eliminate:
    - The only renewable source of many rare items (enchanted books, explorer maps)
    - Emerald-based trading economy
    - Automatic farming systems through farmer behavior
    - Iron golem spawning mechanics
    - Village structures as safe zones for players
    - Complex social behaviors and gossip system

    They bridge the gap between wild survival mechanics and civilization,
    providing late-game progression through trading halls and specialized
    item acquisition. Their agricultural practices make them the only mob
    that actively manages and produces food rather than just consuming it.

  design_notes: |
    Villagers are intentionally complex, with multiple interconnected systems:
    - 15 professions with unique workstation requirements
    - 7 biome variants (cosmetic but important for worldbuilding)
    - 5-tier trading progression system
    - Gossip/reputation system affecting prices
    - Bed-based population limiting
    - Daily schedule with 6 distinct phases
    - Zombie conversion mechanics
    - Iron golem summoning

    Key balance considerations:
    - Breeding limited by bed count prevents infinite villager farms without structure
    - Trading restocking (2x/day) prevents infinite resource generation
    - Profession locking after first trade encourages deliberation
    - Gossip decay prevents permanent reputation (except curing)
    - Iron golem cap (1 per 10 villagers) prevents golem spam

    The nitwit mechanic (10% of babies) adds variety - they can breed and
    socialize but cannot work, representing neurodiversity in the population.

    For ecology mod purposes, villagers should maintain their vanilla complexity
    while integrating with ecosystem-wide systems like predator detection and
    population dynamics. Their unique behaviors should take precedence over
    generalized animal systems.
