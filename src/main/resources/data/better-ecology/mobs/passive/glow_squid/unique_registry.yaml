# [UNIQUE] SPECIAL BEHAVIORS
# ============================================================================

unique_behaviors:
  - name: "bioluminescent_glow"
    description: |
      The glow squid is bioluminescent, constantly emitting a soft cyan glow that illuminates
      the dark underground waters where it dwells.

      WHEN: At all times while alive
      WHERE: Anywhere in water
      WHAT:
        - Emits cyan glowing particles constantly (light level effect)
        - When damaged, particle emission intensifies dramatically for 2-3 seconds
        - Creates aesthetic glow effect similar to vanilla behavior
        - Provides subtle ambient lighting in completely dark environments
      WHY:
        - Ecological: Bioluminescence may serve as camouflage in deep water or communication
        - Gameplay: Provides visual interest and minor light source in dark caves
        - Makes the mob easier to spot in dark underground lakes

    implementation_hints:
      trigger_type: "STATE"
      priority: 5
      duration: null
      affects_others: false
      world_modification: false

  - name: "hypnotic_defense"
    description: |
      When damaged by a player or mob, the glow squid releases a burst of glowing particles
      that create a hypnotic effect, briefly disorienting attackers.

      WHEN: Immediately upon taking damage
      WHERE: Anywhere in water
      WHAT:
        - Releases a burst of cyan glowing particles in all directions
        - Particle burst is more intense than normal glow
        - Lasts 2-3 seconds before returning to normal glow level
        - Does not inflict any status effects (vanilla behavior)
      WHY:
        - Ecological: Defensive adaptation to startle/confuse predators
        - Gameplay: Visual feedback when damaging the mob
        - Matches vanilla Minecraft glow squid behavior

    implementation_hints:
      trigger_type: "EVENT"
      priority: 1
      duration: 60             # 3 seconds
      affects_others: true
      world_modification: false

  - name: "darkness_requirement"
    description: |
      Glow squids only spawn in complete darkness (light level 0) below Y=30. This makes
      them exclusive to deep underground water bodies and rare to encounter.

      WHEN: During natural spawning
      WHERE: Any water block below Y=30 with light level 0
      WHAT:
        - Check light level must be exactly 0
        - Altitude must be Y=30 or lower
        - Must be in water block
        - Can spawn in any biome that meets these conditions
      WHY:
        - Ecological: Simulates deep-sea dwelling behavior
        - Gameplay: Creates rarity and encourages deep cave exploration
        - Makes glow ink sacs a valuable resource

    implementation_hints:
      trigger_type: "LOCATION"

# ============================================================================
# [UNIQUE] NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
# ============================================================================

narrative:
  summary: |
    The glow squid is a bioluminescent cephalopod that dwells in the darkest depths of underground
    water bodies. Unlike its surface-dwelling cousin the squid, it has adapted to total darkness
    through the evolution of natural bioluminescence, creating an eerie cyan glow in pitch-black caves.

  behavior_overview: |
    Glow squids are solitary, passive creatures that drift lazily through deep underground lakes and
    flooded caverns. They are filter feeders, sustaining themselves on microscopic organisms in the water.
    Their most striking feature is their constant bioluminescent glow, which intensifies dramatically when
    they are threatened or harmed. This defensive display serves to startle predators like axolotls. They
    are extremely shy around players and will flee when approached. Unlike regular squids, they cannot
    breed and are only found through natural spawning in completely dark environments below Y=30.

  ecological_importance: |
    Glow squids serve as a unique deep-cave indicator species, signaling to players that they have found
    a sufficiently dark underground water source. They provide a renewable source of glow ink sacs, which
    have decorative applications. Ecologically, they represent an adaptation to extreme low-light
    environments and serve as prey for underground predators like axolotls. Their bioluminescence adds
    atmospheric value to deep cave systems. If removed, deep caves would lose their primary source of
    natural bioluminescent life and glow ink sacs would become unobtainable.

  design_notes: |
    - Glow squids cannot breed in vanilla Minecraft, so reproduction is disabled
    - They require total darkness (light level 0) to spawn, making them rare
    - The bioluminescence is purely visual and doesn't actually emit block light
    - When damaged, particle emission should significantly increase for visual feedback
    - They should be more common in deep dark biomes and underground aquifers
    - Consider spawning them in groups of 2-4 to create visually striking clusters
    - They are completely passive and have no aggressive behaviors
    - Movement should be slow, graceful floating/swimming behavior
