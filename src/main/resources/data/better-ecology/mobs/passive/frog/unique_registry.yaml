unique_behaviors:
  - name: "tongue_attack"
    description: |
      Frogs hunt small slimes and magma cubes using a unique tongue attack mechanic.

      WHEN: When a small slime or small magma cube is within 10 blocks and the frog is hungry
      WHERE: Any location where prey is visible
      WHAT: The frog extends its tongue rapidly (within 0.5 seconds) to pull the prey into its mouth.
            The tongue should have a projectile-like visual that extends from the frog to the target.
            Upon successful hit, the prey is instantly consumed and a froglight is dropped.
      WHY: This unique hunting method makes frogs distinct and provides the froglight production mechanic

      IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
      - Attack range: 10 blocks
      - Attack cooldown: 40 ticks (2 seconds)
      - 100% success rate on small slimes/magma cubes
      - Produces froglight based on frog variant:
        * Temperate (orange) frog + magma cube = ochre froglight
        * Warm (white) frog + magma cube = pearlescent froglight
        * Cold (green) frog + magma cube = verdant froglight
        * Any frog + slime = ochre froglight

      world_modification: true

  - name: "froglight_production"
    description: |
      When a frog consumes a small slime or magma cube with its tongue, it produces a froglight.

      WHEN: Immediately after successful tongue attack consumption
      WHERE: At the frog's location
      WHAT: Drop a froglight block as an item. The color depends on:
            - Frog variant (temperate/warm/cold)
            - Prey type (slime vs magma cube)
      WHY: This is the primary gameplay mechanic for frogs - renewable decorative light sources

      FROGLIGHT COLOR RULES:
      - Temperate (orange) frog + magma cube = ochre froglight
      - Warm (white) frog + magma cube = pearlescent froglight
      - Cold (green) frog + magma cube = verdant froglight
      - Any frog + slime = ochre froglight (default)

  - name: "tadpole_lifecycle"
    description: |
      Frogs have a unique lifecycle involving tadpoles.

      WHEN: When breeding occurs (fed slimeball near water)
      WHERE: In water blocks
      WHAT: Instead of spawning baby frogs, frogs spawn tadpoles (separate entity).
            Tadpoles swim in water and after 24000 ticks (20 minutes) transform into
            adult frogs. The frog variant (temperate/warm/cold) is determined by the
            biome where the tadpole grows up, NOT the parent's variant.
      WHY: Unique lifecycle adds biological realism and allows variant diversity

      TADPOLE TRANSFORMATION RULES:
      - Warm biomes (desert, jungle, badlands, savanna) = warm (white) frog
      - Cold biomes (snowy plains, ice spikes, frozen river) = cold (green) frog
      - Temperate biomes (swamp, plains, forest, etc.) = temperate (orange) frog

    implementation_hints:
      trigger_type: "EVENT"
      priority: 8
      duration: 24000
      affects_others: true
      world_modification: false

  - name: "variant_based_appearance"
    description: |
      Frogs have three distinct visual variants based on biome origin.

      WHEN: Constant (inherent trait)
      WHERE: N/A
      WHAT: Frogs display different colors based on variant:
            - Temperate: Orange/brown coloration
            - Warm: White/cream coloration
            - Cold: Green coloration
            Each variant has the same stats and behaviors, only appearance differs.
      WHY: Visual diversity and biome adaptation representation

  - name: "jumping_locomotion"
    description: |
      Frogs move primarily by jumping rather than walking.

      WHEN: During normal movement
      WHERE: On land (not in water)
      WHAT: Instead of smooth walking animation, frogs should hop/jump to move.
            Jump height up to 3 blocks. Movement should appear as a series of
            short or long jumps depending on distance to target.
      WHY: Realistic amphibian movement pattern

    description: |
      Frogs prefer to stay near water and will return to it when threatened.

      WHEN: When not engaged in other priority behaviors
      WHERE: Within home range
      WHAT: Frogs should pathfind to stay within 16 blocks of water sources.
            When fleeing from threats, they prioritize escaping to water.
            In water, they can swim efficiently and are harder to catch.
      WHY: Amphibious nature requires water access for safety and breeding

# [UNIQUE] NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION
# ============================================================================
# Free-form description for AI to understand this mob's "character"
# ============================================================================

narrative:
  summary: |
    Frogs are small amphibious creatures that hunt tiny slimes and magma cubes using their
    sticky tongues, producing decorative froglights as a unique byproduct. They come in three
    color variants determined by the biome where they mature from tadpoles.

  behavior_overview: |
    Frogs are most active during dawn, dusk, and nighttime hours, spending their days resting
    on lily pads or near water edges. They are opportunistic hunters, using their long sticky
    tongues to snatch small slimes and magma cubes from up to 10 blocks away. When threatened,
    they flee toward water where they can swim to safety. Frogs are solitary creatures that only
    seek mates when well-fed and near water. Their unique lifecycle involves spawning tadpoles
    that swim freely before transforming into adult frogs based on their environment.

    The three variants (temperate orange, warm white, cold green) are purely cosmetic but
    determine the color of froglight produced from magma cubes. This makes frogs valuable for
    players seeking specific decorative lighting blocks.

  ecological_importance: |
    Frogs serve as natural population control for small slimes and magma cubes in swamp biomes.
    They occupy a unique niche as amphibious insectivores that bridge aquatic and terrestrial
    ecosystems. Their tadpole lifecycle adds a temporal dimension to the ecosystem, requiring
    stable water sources for population maintenance. Removal of frogs would allow small slime
    populations to grow unchecked in swamp environments and would eliminate the renewable source
    of froglights for players.

  design_notes: |
    VARIANT MECHANICS: The tadpole-to-frog transformation based on biome temperature is a key
    mechanic that should be preserved. This allows all three variants to appear in appropriate
    biomes even if frogs migrate.

    FROGLIGHT PRODUCTION: The tongue attack must check both frog variant and prey type to
    determine correct froglight color. This is the primary player interaction incentive.

    BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Frogs should not hunt medium or large slimes (too dangerous)
    - Tongue attack range of 10 blocks prevents them from being too powerful
    - Small hitbox (0.5x0.5) makes them vulnerable but hard to accidentally hit
    - Low health (10 HP / 5 hearts) balances their hunting ability

    EDGE CASES:
    - What if no water nearby when breeding? Should fail gracefully or search for water
    - Tadpoles in flowing water should not be swept away too easily
    - Froglight production should not be farmable at exploitative rates (cooldown important)
    - Variant should be stored as persistent data to survive chunk unload/reload
