# ============================================================================

# This is a placeholder. Actual NBT structure files should be created
# using Minecraft's structure block or generated programmatically.
#
# The structure should consist of:
# - Bottom layer: Hay block (representing nest material)
# - Optional: Carpet or similar decorative block on top
#
# Size: 1x1x1 (single block nest)
# Can be expanded to 2x2 for larger bird species
