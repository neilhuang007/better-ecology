## Overview

This document summarizes research on sleep patterns, sleep site selection, vigilance during rest, social sleeping, sleep postures, and unihemispheric sleep across species.

## Sleep Patterns and Activity Cycles

**Three Main Temporal Patterns**:

| Pattern | Percentage | Description | Examples |
|---------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Diurnal** | ~20% of mammals, most birds | Active during day, sleep at night | Humans, cows, ostriches |
| **Nocturnal** | ~70% of mammals | Active at night, sleep during day | Rodents, wild felids |
| **Crepuscular** | ~10% of mammals | Active during twilight (dawn/dusk) | Foxes, rabbits |
| **Cathemeral** | Varies | Active sporadically day or night | Some primates |

**Key Distribution**:
- Mammals are predominantly nocturnal (70%)
- Birds are predominantly diurnal
- These patterns influence sleep timing and anti-predator strategies

## Sleep Site Selection

### Predator Avoidance Hypothesis

Animals select sleeping sites specifically to minimize predation risk.

**Key Factors**:
- **Physical protection**: Steep cliffs, dense vegetation, burrows, tree cavities
- **Concealment**: Hidden spots that reduce detection probability
- **Escape routes**: Sites with quick escape pathways
- **Remote locations**: Larger groups seek more isolated sleeping areas
- **Regular site switching**: Reduces predictability and parasite exposure

**Species Examples**:
- **Primates**: Select sleeping sites based on predator avoidance, often choosing tall trees or cliff edges
- **Small birds**: Use hiding places rather than exposed branches
- **Deer**: Select bed sites with cover and visibility for escape

## Vigilance During Rest

### Core Trade-off

Animals balance sleep needs with maintaining awareness of predators.

**Key Findings**:
- **Increased predation risk** causes animals to shift to lighter, more vigilant sleep states
- **Sleep-related rise in sensory thresholds** creates vulnerability periods
- **Sleep restriction** occurs when predatory risk is elevated

### Vigilance Strategies

- **Lighter sleep states**: Reduced depth of sleep when threat perception is high
- **Sentinel behavior**: Coordinated vigilance where some individuals remain awake while others sleep
- **Synchronized vigilance**: Group members taking turns being alert
- **Asynchronous sleep patterns**: Not all group members sleep simultaneously

## Social Sleeping

### Key Benefits of Group Sleeping

- **Predator dilution effect**: Individual risk decreases as group size increases
- **Increased vigilance**: More eyes watching for threats
- **Shared sentinel duties**: Group members take turns being alert
- **Enhanced detection**: Early warning systems through multiple observers

### Costs

- **Sleep disruption**: Sharing sleeping sites can reduce sleep quality
- **Social interference**: Increased sleep disturbance from group members
- **Reduced sleep may be the price** for lower predation risk

## Sleep Postures

### Birds

- **Head tucked back**: Bill tucked into back/scapular feathers (near-universal posture)
  - Benefits: Heat conservation, neck muscle rest, lower energy consumption
  - Trade-off: Reduced alertness increases predation risk
- **Standing on one leg**: Common in many species
- **Under wing tucking**: Some species for additional protection

### Mammals

- **Curled position**: Heat conservation, protection of vulnerable areas
- **Standing sleep**: Horses, elephants (brief periods)
- **Group huddling**: Social species for warmth and protection
