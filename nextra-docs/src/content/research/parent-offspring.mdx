## Overview

This document summarizes research on mother-offspring attachment, carrying behaviors, imprinting, separation anxiety, and parental care strategies in mammals and other animals.

## Key Findings

### Attachment Mechanisms

**Oxytocin** is the primary hormone modulating maternal responses during the peripartum period, contributing to parturition, lactation, and social bonding.

**Key findings**:
- **Bidirectional bonding process**: Both mother and infant contribute through oxytocin-induced maternal behavior reinforced by infant attachment behaviors (vocalization, suckling)
- **Olfactory recognition** is critical: Mammals use scent cues extensively for mother-infant coordination and individual recognition
- **Critical periods**: Early suckling access is essential; delayed access or oxytocin receptor antagonists alter mother preference in newborns
- **Insecurely attached mothers** show attenuated plasma oxytocin responses to interactions with their children

## Carrying Behaviors by Species

### Primates

**Great apes** use different carrying methods based on species and infant age:
- **Ventral transport** (chest-to-chest) typical in gorillas from birth to ~6 months
- **Dorsal carrying** used as infants grow
- **Biomechanical constraints**: Hair morphology affects carrying ability (gorillas have 10x smaller hair density, creating challenges)
- By ~2 years of age, primate infants begin traveling independently

### Marsupials

- **Pouch attachment**: Extremely underdeveloped young crawl to pouch using tiny front limbs
- **Pouch structure varies**: Kangaroo pouch opens forward; koala pouch opens rearward
- **Continuous attachment**: Joeys remain attached to teats for months while developing
- Evolutionary adaptation protects extremely altricial young

### Carnivores

- **Denning behavior** in bears and wolves provides protected environment
- **Maternal transport** of food back to dens
- **Human proximity** associated with longer maternal care periods in brown bears
- Climate and food availability influence denning patterns

## Following Behaviors and Imprinting

### Precocial mammals (deer, cattle, sheep)

- **Filial imprinting** occurs during sensitive period immediately after birth
- Strong attachment forms to first moving object encountered
- Behavior is often irreversible once established
- Mother-young recognition involves specialized sensory and neurobiological mechanisms

**Two strategies** in ungulates:
- **Hider species**: Offspring remain concealed (fawns)
- **Follower species**: Offspring follow mother immediately

### Altricial mammals (rats, mice)

- Born underdeveloped; require nest-based care
- **Huddling behavior** develops around 15 days
- Strong internal drive toward huddling regardless of kinship
- Ultrasonic vocalizations for maternal-offspring communication

---

## Separation Anxiety

**Distress vocalizations** are universal across mammalian species during maternal separation:

- **Immediate cessation** of vocalizations upon reunion
- **Age-dependent responses**: Intensity varies by developmental stage
- **Long-term effects**: Maternal separation can disrupt parent-child bond formation and cause lifelong behavioral changes
- In rats, these are termed "separation distress calls"
- Daily maternal separation (postnatal days 2-10) affects neurobehavioral responses to isolation

---

## Protection Behaviors

### Maternal Aggression

- Driven by transient mobilization of neural circuits
- Serves as predator defense and protection against infanticidal conspecifics
- Confined largely to late pregnancy and lactation periods
- **Prolactin** (lactation hormone) acts to restrain maternal aggression
- Temporary and reversible behavior

### Herd Positioning

- **Elephants**: Matriarchal herds with allomothering; "aunts" help protect and raise calves
- **Ungulates**: Mothers position to protect offspring from predation; shared responsibilities among mothers
- **Vigilance behavior** temporally structured in females (Thomson's gazelles)
- Predation is major selective force shaping behavioral adaptations

---

## Weaning and Independence

### Developmental Timelines

**Primates**:
- Macaques: minimum weaning 10-14 months
- Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys: varies by ecological/social conditions
- White-headed langurs: maternal rejection promotes independence

**Elephants**:
- Extended maternal care (~5 years)
- Complete weaning can start at 12-14 months with gradual milk reduction
- Generation time ~18 years

**General formula**: Juvenile period = age at first birth - weaning age

### Factors influencing weaning

- Ecological conditions
- Social status
- Maternal experience
- Health and weight of offspring

---

## Species-Specific Variations

### Elephants

- Matriarchal social structure
- Lifelong bonds between females
- Allomothering by younger females/siblings
- Strong bonds maintained through touch and vocalizations
- Calves have multiple caregivers ("aunts")

### Primates

- Facial resemblance guides mothers to promote proximity between offspring
- Face-to-face spatial positioning preferences
- Mothers encourage locomotor skill development
- Significant maternal influence on species-typical behavioral development

### Marsupials

- Extremely prolonged attachment in pouch
- Specialized pouch structures
- Complete development occurs post-birth in protected environment

### Ungulates

- Clear dichotomy: hider vs. follower species
- Contact calls critical for mother-offspring recognition
- Olfactory imprinting immediately after birth

### Carnivores

- Den-based rearing
- Food transport to young
- Context-dependent denning influenced by climate and food

## Implementation Notes for Minecraft Mod

### Key Behaviors to Implement

1. **Following behavior**: Offspring follow mother within range (precocial species like cows, sheep)
2. **Hiding behavior**: Offspring stay hidden/immobile when mother is far (hider species like deer fawns)
3. **Protection behavior**: Mother attacks threats near offspring
4. **Separation distress**: Offspring vocalize when too far from mother
5. **Weaning**: Gradual reduction of dependency as offspring ages
6. **Allomothering**: Other adults help protect young (elephants, some herd animals)

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Default Range | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `followingDistance` | 3-8 blocks | Distance offspring follows mother |
| `hiderHideDuration` | 0-300 ticks | Time hider offspring stays hidden |
| `protectionRange` | 6-16 blocks | Mother protects offspring within this |
| `separationDistressThreshold` | 8-24 blocks | Distance causing distress calls |
| `weaningAge` | Species-dependent | Age when offspring becomes independent |
| `carryDuration` | Species-dependent | How long mother carries young |
| `allomotheringEnabled` | true/false | Other adults help protect young |

### Minecraft Entity Considerations

**Vanilla animals that could benefit**:
- **Cows, Sheep, Pigs, Chickens**: Following behavior for babies
- **Wolves**: Mother protection + following
- **Cats, Ocelots**: Carrying behavior (kittens follow closely)
- **Horses**: Foals following mothers
- **Rabbits**: Baby rabbits hiding (hider species behavior)
- **Turtles**: Mother returns to nest area (simplified)

**New behaviors to add**:
- Mother animals become aggressive when babies are threatened
- Babies vocalize when separated from mother
- Herd animals protect all young in the herd (allomothering)
- Gradual independence as babies age

### Code Structure Suggestion

```java
public class FollowMotherBehavior extends Behavior {
    private final double followDistance;
    private final double speedModifier;

    @Override
    public boolean canStart() {
        if (baby.age > weaningAge) return false;
        AnimalEntity mother = baby.getMother();
        return mother != null && baby.distanceTo(mother) > followDistance;
    }

    @Override
    public void tick() {
        AnimalEntity mother = baby.getMother();
        if (mother != null) {
            baby.getNavigation().moveToEntity(mother, speedModifier);
        }
    }
}

public class MotherProtectionBehavior extends Behavior {
    private final double protectionRange;

    @Override
    public void tick() {
        List<BabyAnimal> babies = getNearbyBabies(protectionRange);
        for (BabyAnimal baby : babies) {
            ThreatEntity threat = findThreatTo(baby);
            if (threat != null) {
                mother.setTarget(threat);
                mother.getNavigation().moveToEntity(threat, 1.5);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
