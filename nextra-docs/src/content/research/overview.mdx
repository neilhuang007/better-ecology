| [Flocking](/research/flocking) | Boids algorithm, topological interactions, V-formation |
| [Parent-Offspring](/research/parent-offspring) | Attachment, bonding, imprinting, weaning |

### Survival Behaviors

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Fleeing](/research/fleeing) | Flight initiation distance, escape strategies, panic |
| [Foraging](/research/foraging) | Marginal value theorem, patch selection, grazing |

### Life Cycle Behaviors

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Breeding](/research/breeding) | Courtship, mate selection, territoriality |
| [Sleep](/research/sleep) | Activity cycles, rest patterns, vigilance |

## Key Academic References

The following foundational works inform the behavior implementations:

## Implementation Approach

Research findings are translated into Minecraft implementations through:

1. **Parameter extraction**: Identifying key behavioral thresholds
2. **Algorithm design**: Creating simplified models of complex behaviors
3. **Balance tuning**: Adjusting for gameplay while maintaining scientific accuracy
4. **Configuration exposure**: Making parameters adjustable via data files

Each research document includes implementation notes specific to Minecraft entities.
