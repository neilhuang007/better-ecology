## Overview

This document summarizes research on herd movement, leadership dynamics, and collective decision-making in wild ungulates and other social mammals.

## Key Findings

### Collective Decision-Making Frameworks

**Shared vs. Hierarchical Decision-Making**
- **Shared decision-making** reduces conflicts during movement initiation (observed in wild baboons and vulturine guineafowl)
- **Partially-shared decision-making** occurs in species like kiang (Tibetan wild ass), where copying neighbors provides adaptive wisdom for harsh environments
- **Democratic consensus** in bison herds: movements typically don't begin until approximately 47% of adult members have joined

**Leadership Structures Vary by Species**
- **Ungulates**: Older, high-ranking (dominant) females are most commonly leaders during collective movements
- **Elephants**: Matriarchal leadership (African elephants) with oldest female guiding the herd; Asian elephants lack clear matriarchal hierarchies
- **Cattle**: Neither age nor dominance consistently influence movement order
- **Bison**: All individuals can lead herds at least once; leadership varies during each movement event

## How Herds Move Together

### Mathematical Models

**Couzin Model (2002)**
A foundational self-organizing model showing collective behavior emerges from simple local interactions without centralized control:
- Spatial sorting occurs naturally based on individual interactions
- A small minority of informed individuals can guide group movement
- Decentralized leadership emerges from neighbor-based responses

**Boids Algorithm (Reynolds, 1986)**
Simulates flocking using three simple rules:
1. **Separation**: Avoid crowding neighbors
2. **Alignment**: Steer towards average heading of neighbors
3. **Cohesion**: Move toward average position of neighbors

**Quorum Sensing**
- Groups use threshold-based decision rules (quorum responses) to achieve consensus
- First documented in ants (Leptothorax albipennis) during colony emigration
- Waiting for a threshold number of supporters before initiating action enables optimal pooling of independent information

## Leadership Dynamics

### Leadership Emergence Mechanisms

- **Age and experience**: Older individuals possess knowledge of resources, migration routes, and predator threats
- **Social dominance**: High-ranking individuals in ungulate herds often lead movements
- **Shared leadership**: Multiple individuals can initiate movements depending on context and needs
- **Physiological costs**: Leadership in collective movements incurs energetic and physiological costs

**Key Finding**: The concept of "leadership" in animals remains loosely defined in ethology, with a 2015 PLOS One study questioning its reliability as a consistent concept across species.

## Following Behavior

### Consensus Decision-Making

- **Democratic processes**: Average behavior of individuals is adopted (observed in fish schools and some ungulate herds)
- **Recruitment mechanisms**: Individuals join movements based on social interactions and neighbor copying
- **Variable participation**: Different individuals may initiate or join depending on motivation and context

**Following Rules**:
- Individuals adjust movement in response to neighbors' movements and positions
- Faster swimmers/movers in fish collectives determine direction and gain followers
- Visual and auditory cues from leaders guide following behavior

## Herding Triggers

### Movement Initiation

- **Physiological needs**: Hunger and thirst regulate motivated behavior through neural mechanisms
- **Environmental changes**: Weather, temperature changes, and seasonal shifts trigger movement
- **Resource availability**: Migration patterns track seasonal resource availability (wildebeest, mule deer, pronghorn)
- **Social triggers**: Initiators use specific postures and social interactions to recruit followers

### Stopping and Direction Change

- Research by Pillot (2010) identifies different types of collective movements including short and long movements as well as stopping mechanisms
- Groups coordinate stops through communication postures and social interaction
- Direction changes emerge from distributed decision-making rather than centralized control

## Predator Response

### Collective Anti-Predator Strategies

- **Dilution effect**: Individual predation risk decreases as group size increases
- **Confusion effect**: Predators have difficulty targeting individuals when groups move together
- **Many-eyes effect**: Larger groups detect predators earlier through shared vigilance
- **Selfish herd theory**: Individuals reduce predation risk by positioning other conspecifics between themselves and predators

### Spatial Risk Response

- Wildebeest movements respond to local intensity of predator use ("landscape of fear")
- Predation strongly limits demography; wildebeest respond to spatial variation in long-term risks from complete predator guild

**Research Gap**: Limited documentation on conditions that trigger scattering (stampede) vs. cohesive escape responses in ungulates.

---

## Spatial Organization

### Selfish Herd Theory

- **Perimeter vs. Center**: Predation risk is greatest on the periphery and decreases toward the center
- **Positioning strategies**: Individuals actively move to reduce risk by positioning others between themselves and predators
- **Temporal dynamics**: Risk changes as aggregations form over time

### Vigilance Patterns

- **Edge individuals**: Higher anti-predator vigilance due to increased exposure
- **Center individuals**: Lower vigilance, more social vigilance
- **Scanning behavior**: Defined as head upward, standing erect posture
- **Flock size effects**: Larger groups enable shared vigilance and reduced individual scanning time

---

## Species Examples

### Ungulates (Deer, Antelope, Bison, Elk)

- Linear dominance hierarchies based on age and size (especially in bulls)
- Bison are socially dominant over elk
- Migratory species (mule deer, pronghorn, wildebeest) show site fidelity to migration corridors
- Leadership varies between species; age and dominance matter more in some than others

### Elephants

- **African elephants**: Clear matriarchal structure; oldest female leads
- **Asian elephants**: Lack clear matriarchal leadership, less cohesive family groups
- Matriarchs guide groups to vital resources (food, water)
- Adult females coordinate defensive responses to threats
- Wisdom and experience valued over speed; emphasis on protection over power

### Wildebeest Migration

- Famous Serengeti migration spanning scales from "single steps to mass migration"
- Recent work developed near real-time behavior classifiers using edge machine learning to understand fine-scale behavior
- Movements respond to both bottom-up resource availability and top-down predation risk
- Landscape of fear influences spatial distribution beyond seasonal/diurnal patterns

## Key Behavioral Patterns Summary

| Pattern | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Consensus decisions** | Groups wait for threshold support before moving | Bison (47% quorum), ants |
| **Age/experience-based leadership** | Older individuals lead using knowledge | Elephants, ungulates |
| **Shared leadership** | Multiple potential leaders depending on context | Bison, some ungulates |
| **Selfish positioning** | Individuals minimize risk by positioning | Ungulate herds, bird flocks |
| **Many-eyes vigilance** | Shared scanning reduces individual predation risk | Zebras, impala, coatis |
| **Quorum responses** | Threshold-based decisions prevent premature action | Ants, collective movement generally |
| **Democratic consensus** | Average behavior of group is adopted | Fish schools, some ungulates |

## Implementation Notes for Minecraft Mod

### Key Behaviors to Implement

1. **Quorum-based movement initiation**: Animals wait until X% of group joins before moving
2. **Age/experience-based leadership**: Older animals lead; others follow
3. **Selfish herd positioning**: Weaker/younger animals seek center positions
4. **Vigilance sharing**: Animals take turns being alert while others feed
5. **Leadership rotation**: Different animals can lead based on context (knowledge, hunger)
