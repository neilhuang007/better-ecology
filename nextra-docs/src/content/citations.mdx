## Why Research-Based Development?

Better Ecology is built on peer-reviewed scientific research rather than general observation or game design conventions. This approach ensures that animal behaviors are:

- **Scientifically accurate**: Grounded in real-world ethology and behavioral ecology
- **Mechanistically sound**: Based on documented biological mechanisms (e.g., oxytocin in parent-offspring bonding)
- **Quantitatively calibrated**: Using empirically measured parameters (e.g., 6-7 topological neighbors in bird flocks)
- **Evolutionarily justified**: Behaviors serve documented adaptive purposes (e.g., marginal value theorem for foraging)

By anchoring game mechanics to research, the mod creates emergent gameplay that reflects natural complexity while remaining internally consistent and predictable.

## Research Methodology Notes

### Citation Metrics

Citation counts referenced in research documentation are provided for context regarding the influence and acceptance of specific papers within the scientific community. These metrics were current as of the research compilation date and help identify foundational versus emerging findings.

### Implementation Adaptations

While Better Ecology is based on peer-reviewed research, certain adaptations were necessary for Minecraft integration:

- **Spatial scaling**: Real-world distances converted to Minecraft block units
- **Time compression**: Animal behaviors occur on accelerated timescales for gameplay
- **Simplified neurochemistry**: Complex hormonal systems (oxytocin, prolactin) represented through behavior flags
- **Discrete resources**: Continuous resource gradients simplified to block-based patch quality

These adaptations maintain mechanistic fidelity while ensuring playable, performant gameplay.
