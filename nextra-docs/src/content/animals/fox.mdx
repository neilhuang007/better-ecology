## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 10 HP (5 hearts) |
| Damage | 2 |
| Diet | Berries, chickens, rabbits, fish |
| Activity Pattern | Crepuscular (dawn/dusk) |
| Social Type | Solitary/pair |

## Behaviors

### Hunting

Foxes actively hunt small prey.

**Prey Targets:**
- Chickens
- Rabbits
- Fish (if accessible)

**Hunting Techniques:**
- Stalk approach
- Pounce attack
- Chase for fleeing prey

### Food Caching

Foxes store excess food for later retrieval.

**Caching Behavior:**
- Bury food items in ground
- Remember cache locations
- Return when hungry

**Cache Management:**
- Multiple cache sites
- Prioritize recent caches
- Defend caches from theft

### Item Storage

**Implementation:** `AnimalItemStorage`

Foxes carry items in their mouths (shared component with wolves).

**Mechanics:**
- Pick up items from ground
- Carry while moving
- Drop or consume items

### Crepuscular Activity

Foxes are most active at dawn and dusk.

**Activity Pattern:**
- Peak activity: Dawn and dusk
- Reduced activity: Midday
- Sleep during bright day/deep night

**Trigger:**
- Light level changes
- Time of day
- Weather conditions

### Berry Foraging

Foxes eat berries from sweet berry bushes.

**Foraging Behavior:**
- Seek sweet berry bushes
- Harvest berries
- Consume or cache berries

## Social Behavior

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Social Type | Solitary or mated pairs |
| Territory | Established around den |
| Pair Bonding | Seasonal breeding |

## Configuration

Fox behaviors use the shared `AnimalItemStorage` component and integrate with the ecology system.

## Scientific Basis

### Food Caching
Based on research on fox caching behavior and memory for cache locations.

### Crepuscular Activity
Based on observed activity patterns in wild fox populations.

### Hunting Behavior
Based on documented fox hunting techniques including stalking and pouncing.
