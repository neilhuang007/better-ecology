## Behaviors

### Seed Finding

**Discoverable Items:**
- Torchflower seeds
- Pitcher pods

- Sniff for nearby seeds
- Dig when seeds detected
- Cooldown between digs

### Digging

Sniffers dig in dirt-type blocks.

- Muddy mangrove roots
- Moss blocks

### Movement

Sniffers move slowly and deliberately.

- Slow walk speed
- Large turning radius
- Prefer open areas
- Rest between activities

### Egg Hatching

Sniffer eggs hatch into snifflets.

- Eggs placed by breeding
- Hatching takes time
- Crack stages before hatching

## Scientific Basis

Sniffer behavior is inspired by prehistoric megafauna and modern animals that forage by smell (like pigs and their truffle finding).
