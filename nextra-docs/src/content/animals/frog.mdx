## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 10 HP (5 hearts) |
| Habitat | Swamp, varied by variant |
| Social Type | Loose groups |
| Variants | Temperate, Warm, Cold |

## Behaviors

### Tongue Attack

Frogs eat small creatures with their tongue.

**Prey:**
- Slimes (small)
- Magma cubes (small)

- Produces froglights when eating magma cubes
- Froglight color depends on frog variant

### Tadpole Care

Frogs start as tadpoles.

- Tadpoles are aquatic
- Grow into frogs over time
- Biome temperature determines variant

### Jumping Movement

Frogs move primarily by jumping.

- Long jump distance
- Water navigation
- Land and water mobility

### Croaking

Frogs vocalize in swamp environments.

- Ambient croaking sounds
- More active at dawn and dusk

## Variants

| Variant | Biome | Froglight Color |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Temperate | Swamp | Ochre |
| Warm | Warm biomes | Pearlescent |
| Cold | Cold biomes | Verdant |

## Scientific Basis

Based on frog development and amphibian behavior patterns.
