| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 14 HP (7 hearts) |
| Habitat | Underwater caves |
| Social Type | Solitary |
| Special Ability | Play dead |

## Behaviors

### Aquatic Hunting

Axolotls hunt aquatic prey.

**Prey Types:**
- Fish (all types)
- Squid
- Glow squid

### Play Dead

Axolotls feign death when damaged.

- Triggered at low health
- Regenerates health while playing dead
- Enemies lose interest
- Temporary invulnerability

### Regeneration

Axolotls heal over time.

- Passive health regeneration
- Enhanced healing when playing dead
- Based on real axolotl regeneration

### Bucket Behavior

- Can be captured in water buckets
- Retain all data when bucketed
- Release with full behavior state

## Scientific Basis

Based on real axolotl behavior, particularly their remarkable regeneration abilities and neoteny.
