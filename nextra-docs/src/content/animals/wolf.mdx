## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 20 HP (10 hearts, tamed: 40 HP) |
| Damage | 4 (wild), 8 (tamed) |
| Tameable | Yes |
| Pack Animal | Yes |
| Social Type | Pack hierarchy |

## Behaviors

### Pack Dynamics

Wolves form packs with social hierarchies and shared behaviors.

**Pack Identification:**
- UUID-based pack IDs stored in NBT
- Tamed wolves excluded from wild pack behaviors
- Pack members recognized via pack ID matching

**Hierarchy System:**

| Rank | Role |
|------|------|
| Alpha | Pack leader, priority in feeding |
| Beta | Secondary rank |
| Omega | Lowest rank |

### Food Sharing System

**Implementation:** `WolfShareFoodGoal`, `WolfPickupItemGoal`

Wolves exhibit altruistic food sharing behavior within their pack.

**Pickup Behavior:**
- Search radius for meat items: 16 blocks
- Picks up items tagged with `minecraft:meat`
- Altruistic: picks up food even when not hungry if pack is hungry

**Sharing Priority:**

| Priority | Recipient |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 (highest) | Mate |
| 2 | Alpha |
| 3 | Other hungry pack members |

**Search Behavior:**
- 32 block search radius for hungry pack members
- Respects pack boundaries
- Tamed wolves excluded from wild pack behaviors

### Pack Hunting

Wolves coordinate hunting as a pack.

**Coordination:**
- Pack members share targets
- Coordinated approach to prey
- Social hierarchy influences attack order

### Territorial Defense

Wolves defend their territory from intruders.

**Territory Behavior:**
- Establish territory around den/home area
- Warn intruders with growling
- Pack defends territory together

### Item Storage

**Implementation:** `AnimalItemStorage`

Wolves can carry items (shared component with foxes).

**Mechanics:**
- Visual rendering of held items
- NBT persistence for carried items
- Integration with feeding and sharing systems

## NBT Data

Pack state is persisted in NBT:

```
BetterEcology.wolf_behavior -> {
  pack_id: <UUID>,
  hierarchy_rank: <string>,
  carried_item: <ItemStack>
}
```

## Goal Classes

| Goal | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `WolfPickupItemGoal` | Picking up meat items |
| `WolfShareFoodGoal` | Sharing food with pack |
| `PredatorFeedingGoal` | Opportunistic scavenging |

## Visual Rendering

**Implementation:** `WolfHeldItemLayer`

Client-side rendering for wolves carrying items provides visual feedback on wolf state.

## Integration

### Hunger System
- Wolves have hunger needs
- Eating restores hunger
- Hungry wolves seek food more actively

### Predation System
- Integration with existing hunting behaviors
- Pack coordination during hunts

## Scientific Basis

### Pack Behavior
Based on wolf pack dynamics research showing social hierarchies and cooperative behaviors.

### Food Sharing
Based on observations of altruistic food sharing in wolf packs, particularly between mates and toward pack leaders.

### Territorial Behavior
Based on research on wolf territory establishment and defense patterns.
