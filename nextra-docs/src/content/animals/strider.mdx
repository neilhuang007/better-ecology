## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 20 HP (10 hearts) |
| Habitat | Nether lava lakes |
| Rideable | Yes (with saddle) |
| Control Item | Warped fungus on stick |

## Behaviors

### Lava Walking

Striders walk on lava surfaces.

- Move freely on lava
- Slow when on solid ground
- Shiver when cold (not on lava)

### Temperature Sensitivity

Striders are adapted to heat.

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| On lava | Normal, warm |
| In rain | Damage |
| On land | Cold, shivering, slow |

### Baby Riding

Baby striders ride on adult striders.

- Passive riding behavior
- Fall off when adult submerges
- Group movement

### Following

Striders follow players holding warped fungus.

- Breeding item: Warped fungus
- Control with warped fungus on stick

## Movement

| Surface | Speed |
|---------|-------|
| Lava | Full speed |
| Land | Reduced speed |
| Water | Damage, avoid |

## Scientific Basis

Strider behavior is fantasy-based but inspired by extremophile organisms adapted to harsh environments.
