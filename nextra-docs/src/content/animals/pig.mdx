## Behaviors

### Rooting Behavior

**Implementation:** `PigRootingGoal`

Pigs root in soil to find truffles, a valuable food item.

**Rootable Blocks and Truffle Chances:**

| Block Type | Truffle Chance |
|------------|----------------|
| Grass blocks | 5% |
| Mycelium | 15% (highest) |
| Podzol | 12% |
| Regular dirt | 0% |

**Behavior Details:**
- Rooting duration: 40 ticks (2 seconds)
- Search range: 8 blocks
- 30% chance to convert grass to dirt after rooting
- Spawns dirt particles during rooting
- Plays pig ambient sounds

### Truffle Hunting

Pigs can detect and actively pursue truffles.

**Truffle Item Properties:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Nutrition | 6 hunger points |
| Saturation | 0.6 |
| Rarity | Rare (blue item name) |

**Detection Behaviors:**
- Pigs show heart particles when truffles are within 8 blocks
- Different soil types affect discovery rates

### Truffle Seeking

**Implementation:** `PigTruffleSeekGoal`

Pigs actively pursue dropped truffles they detect.

**Behavior Details:**
- Detection range: 16 blocks
- Movement speed: 1.2x normal
- Cooldown: 30 seconds after seeking
- Shows sniffing particles while tracking
- Heart particles when close to truffle
- High priority (overrides most other behaviors)

### Truffle Sniffing

**Implementation:** `PigSniffTrufflesGoal`

Pigs pause and sniff when detecting interesting scents.

**Detection Targets:**
- Dropped truffle items (highest priority)
- Nearby food crops
- Mycelium or podzol blocks

**Behavior Details:**
- Detection range: 12 blocks
- Sniff duration: 3 seconds
- Cooldown: 10 seconds
- Pig looks toward scent source
- Sneeze particle effects and sniffing sounds

### Mud Bathing

**Implementation:** `PigMudBathingGoal`

Pigs seek out mud, water, or clay to bathe for temperature regulation.

**Benefits:**
- Restores condition (+2 per second while bathing)
- Provides temperature regulation in hot weather
- Applies visual mud effect (5 minutes / 6000 ticks)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Random chance (5% for adults, 10% for babies)
- Increased likelihood when health is below 80%
- Increased likelihood during hot daytime

**Behavior Details:**
- Bathing duration: 200 ticks (10 seconds)
- Search range: 16 blocks
- Water dripping particle effects
- Ambient sounds at lower pitch

### Social Mud Bathing

**Implementation:** `PigSocialMudBathingGoal`

Pigs in mud attract other pigs to join them.

**Behavior Details:**
- Attraction range: 12 blocks
- Chance to attract: 30% per nearby pig
- Maximum 4 pigs per group bath
- Social duration: 20 seconds
- Happy villager particles when group forms

### Crop Feeding

**Implementation:** `PigFeedingGoal`

Pigs seek out and eat fully grown crops.

**Edible Crops:**

| Crop | Hunger Restoration |
|------|-------------------|
| Carrots | +20 |
| Potatoes | +25 |
| Beetroots | +15 |

**Behavior Details:**
- Heals 1 HP (0.5 hearts) when eating
- Eating duration: 30 ticks (1.5 seconds)
- Destroys the crop block
- Search range: 12 blocks

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Random chance (15% normally, 20% for babies)
- Increased to 40% when hunger is below 50

## Hunger System

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum | 100 |
| Starting | 75 |
| Decay Rate | 0.015 per tick |
| Starvation Damage | 1 HP every 10 seconds below 5 hunger |

## Condition System

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum | 100 |
| Starting | 70 |
| Effect | Affects breeding success and truffle finding |
| Gain | When satiated |
| Loss | When hungry/starving |

## Social System

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Herd animal |
| Social Range | 16 blocks |
| Decay Rate | 0.008 per tick when alone |
| Recovery Rate | 0.1 per tick near herd |
| Loneliness Threshold | 40 |

## Goal Priority System

| Priority | Goal |
|----------|------|
| 0 | FloatGoal (vanilla) |
| 3 | PigTruffleSeekGoal |
| 4 | WaterAvoidingRandomStrollGoal |
| 5 | Rooting, MudBathing, SocialMudBathing, Feeding |
| 6 | Sniffing |

## Visual Effects

### Mud Effect
- Brown tint overlay when pig has mud effect
- Alpha fades over 5 minutes
- Registered in client renderer

## Configuration

All pig behaviors use hardcoded scientific constants based on real pig behavior research. Behaviors are implemented via code-based handles in the pig mixin.

## Scientific Basis

### Truffle Hunting
Based on the real practice of using pigs to find truffles, which exploits their natural rooting behavior and keen sense of smell.

### Mud Bathing
Based on thermoregulation behavior in pigs, which lack sweat glands and use mud to cool down and protect their skin.

### Rooting
Based on natural foraging behavior where pigs use their snouts to search for food in the soil.

### Social Behavior
Based on natural herd dynamics observed in wild and domestic pigs.
