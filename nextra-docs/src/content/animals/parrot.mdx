## Behaviors

### Mimicking System

**Implementation:** `MimicBehavior`, `ParrotMimicGoal`

Parrots mimic hostile mob sounds as a warning system for players.

**Base Accuracy:** 55-95% (varies by individual parrot)

**Mimic Types:**

| Mob Type | Sound Event | Rarity |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Zombie | `PARROT_IMITATE_ZOMBIE` | Common |
| Skeleton | `PARROT_IMITATE_SKELETON` | Common |
| Spider | `PARROT_IMITATE_SPIDER` | Common |
| Creeper | `PARROT_IMITATE_CREEPER` | Uncommon |
| Enderman | `PARROT_IMITATE_ENDERMAN` | Rare |
| Witch | `PARROT_IMITATE_WITCH` | Rare |
| Wither Skeleton | `PARROT_IMITATE_WITHER_SKELETON` | Rare |
| Ravager | `PARROT_IMITATE_RAVAGER` | Rare |
| Phantom | `PARROT_IMITATE_PHANTOM` | Rare |
| Hoglin | `PARROT_IMITATE_HOGLIN` | Rare |
| Piglin | `PARROT_IMITATE_PIGLIN` | Rare |
| Vindicator | `PARROT_IMITATE_VINDICATOR` | Rare |

**Warning System:**
- Triggered when hostile mob is within 32 blocks
- 80% chance to perform a warning mimic
- Accuracy increases by 15% for warnings
- Shorter cooldown (100 ticks vs 200 ticks)

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mimic": {
    "base_accuracy": 0.75,
    "accuracy_variation": 0.2,
    "mimic_chance": 0.05,
    "warning_range": 32.0,
    "warning_chance": 0.8
  }
}
```

### Dancing Behavior

**Implementation:** `DanceBehavior`, `ParrotMusicGoal`

Parrots dance to music with different styles based on the music disc playing.

**Dance Styles by Music Disc:**

| Disc | Dance Style | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 13, cat | BOUNCE | Rhythmic jumping every 10 ticks |
| blocks, chirp | SPIN | 45-degree rotations every 5 ticks |
| far, mall | WIGGLE | Rapid small movements and head shaking |
| mellohi, stal | HEAD_BOB | Vertical bobbing motion |
| strad, ward | WING_FLAP | Frequent jumping with rotations |
| 11, wait | PARTY | Energetic bouncing and spinning |
| otherside, 5, pigstep, relic | RAVE | Fast spinning with strobe jumping |
| pigstep | DISCO | Smooth rhythmic movements |

**Dance Mechanics:**

| Style | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| BOUNCE | Jump every 10 ticks with slight rotation changes |
| SPIN | Rotate 45 degrees every 5 ticks |
| WIGGLE | Rapid 15-degree rotations and forward/back movement |
| HEAD_BOB | Jump every 8 ticks with head angle changes |
| WING_FLAP | Jump every 6 ticks with 30-degree rotations |
| PARTY | Jump every 5 ticks with random spins |
| RAVE | Spin 30 degrees per tick with strobe jumping |
| DISCO | Smooth sine-wave bobbing and rotation |

**Party Effect:**
- Other parrots within 16 blocks have 30% chance to join
- Dancing parrots emit note particles
- All parrots dance in sync

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "dance": {
    "show_particles": true,
    "enable_party_effect": true,
    "party_radius": 16.0,
    "party_join_chance": 0.3
  }
}
```

### Music Detection

**Implementation:** `MusicDetectionBehavior`

Parrots detect and respond to music sources.

**Detection Range:** 64 blocks (configurable)

**Music Sources:**
- Jukeboxes (detects any playing disc)
- Note blocks (remembers plays for 5 seconds)

**Behavior Sequence:**
1. Parrot detects music within range
2. Determines dance style from the disc
3. Flies toward music source at 1.2x speed
4. Perches nearby (within 6 blocks)
5. Starts dancing with appropriate style

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "music": {
    "detection_radius": 64,
    "flight_speed": 1.2,
    "prefer_high_perches": true
  }
}
```

### Flight and Perching

**Implementation:** `PerchBehavior`, `ParrotPerchGoal`

Parrots seek high perches and can ride on player shoulders.

**Perch Preferences:**
- High perches: 5+ blocks above minimum build height
- Isolation: Avoid perches near threats (cats, foxes, wolves, ocelots)
- Tree coverage: Bonus score for leaf blocks
- Block preferences: Fences and logs get bonus points

**Perch Scoring Formula:**
```
Score = (height * height_bonus)
        - (distance * distance_penalty)
        + (leaf_bonus if leaves)
        + (preferred_block_bonus if preferred block)
        - (threat_penalty / threat_distance)
```

**Shoulder Perching:**
- Only tamed parrots can perch on shoulders
- 3-block detection range
- Uses vanilla shoulder riding system
- Can be spooked off by nearby threats

**Flight Patterns:**

| Type | Speed | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Short bursts | Normal | Direct flight to target perch |
| Gliding | 0.8x | Safe descent to ground |
| Music flights | 1.2x | Flying toward music sources |

**Perch Duration:**
- Maximum: 1200 ticks (60 seconds)
- Random adjustment movements every 40 ticks
- Leave immediately if threatened

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "perch": {
    "search_radius": 32,
    "prefer_high_perches": true,
    "min_perch_height": 5,
    "spook_radius": 8.0,
    "max_perch_ticks": 1200
  }
}
```

## Behavior Priorities

The `ParrotBehaviorGoal` orchestrates behaviors in priority order:

| Priority | Behavior | Condition |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 (highest) | Shoulder Perching | If riding a player |
| 2 | Dancing | If music is playing and parrot has arrived |
| 3 | Flying to Music | If music detected within range |
| 4 | Perching | If currently on a perch |
| 5 | Flying to Perch | Seeking a new perch |
| 6 | Idle | Random wandering |

## Integration

### Note Block Integration
- Mixin intercepts note block plays
- Notifies all parrots within 64 blocks
- Parrots remember note block location and time
- Allows dancing to player-created music

## Performance

### Optimization Strategies
- Reduced scanning: Music detection only every 60 ticks
- Early exits: Skip processing if condition not met
- Cached lookups: Component data cached per tick
- Spatial indexing: Uses existing SpatialIndex for neighbor queries

### Memory Usage
- Component tags store minimal state
- No persistent entity references
- Efficient NBT storage for mimics and perches

## Scientific Basis

### Mimicry
Based on real-world parrot ability to mimic sounds. African Grey Parrots can learn 100+ words, and alarm calls warn flock members of predators.

### Dancing
Based on research into birds responding to music. Cockatoos bob to beats (documented in Snowball the cockatoo), and parrots have an innate sense of rhythm.

### Perching
Based on wild parrot behavior, including preference for high perches for predator detection and sleeping in roosting flocks for safety.

## Troubleshooting

### Parrots Not Dancing
- Check if jukebox has a disc inserted
- Verify parrot is within 64 blocks
- Ensure parrot is not on player's shoulder
- Check that music behavior is enabled

### Parrots Not Mimicking
- Verify hostile mobs are nearby for warning mimics
- Check mimic cooldown (200 ticks between random mimics)
- Individual parrots have varying accuracy (55-95%)

### Parrots Not Perching
- Check if parrot is tamed for shoulder perching
- Verify suitable perches exist within 32 blocks
- Parrots may be spooked by nearby threats
