## Behaviors

### Wool Growth System

**Implementation:** `me.javavirtualenv.ecology.handles.WoolHandle`

Sheep grow wool over time based on nutrition and health. Wool quality affects shearing yield.

**Growth Factors:**
- Requires hunger above 30% to grow wool
- Growth progresses through stages 0-4
- Quality determined by health, condition, and nutrition

**Wool Quality Effects:**

| Quality Range | Classification | Wool Drops |
|---------------|----------------|------------|
| Above 0.8 | Premium | Base + 2 |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | Good | Base + 1 |
| 0.4 - 0.6 | Normal | Base |
| Below 0.4 | Poor | Base - 1 (minimum 1) |

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "wool": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_wool_stage": 4,
    "min_wool_stage_for_shear": 3,
    "base_growth_chance": 0.15,
    "hunger_threshold": 30,
    "base_graze_chance": 0.35,
    "grazing_cooldown": 200,
    "hunger_restoration": 25,
    "base_wool_drops": 1
  }
}
```

### Grazing Behavior

**Implementation:** `me.javavirtualenv.ecology.ai.SheepGrazeGoal`

Sheep actively seek and consume grass blocks to restore hunger.

**Behavior Details:**
- Search radius: 16 blocks
- Converts grass blocks to dirt
- Restores 25 hunger points
- Plays eating sounds and particles

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "grazing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "search_radius": 16.0,
    "speed_modifier": 0.8,
    "priority": 4
  }
}
```

### Flock Dynamics

**Implementation:** `me.javavirtualenv.behavior.sheep.SheepFlockCohesionBehavior`

Sheep exhibit strong flock cohesion instincts, staying close to other sheep.

**Behavior Details:**
- Cohesion radius: 16 blocks
- Move toward flock when distance exceeds 6 blocks
- Experience distress when isolated beyond 20 blocks

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "behaviors": {
    "cohesion": 1.5,
    "herd_cohesion": 1.6,
    "separation": 1.8
  },
  "flock_dynamics": {
    "cohesion_radius": 16.0,
    "distress_radius": 20.0,
    "min_flock_size": 3
  }
}
```

### Separation Distress

**Implementation:** `me.javavirtualenv.behavior.sheep.SheepSeparationDistressBehavior`

When separated from their flock, sheep exhibit distress behaviors.

**Distress Levels:**

| Distance from Flock | Distress Level | Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| 0-6 blocks | 0.0-0.3 | Calm |
| 6-12 blocks | 0.3-0.5 | Mildly concerned |
| 12+ blocks | 0.5-1.0 | Distressed |

**Distress Behaviors:**
- Frequent bleating (interval reduces with distress)
- Higher-pitched vocalizations
- Increased movement speed to regroup
- Worry particle effects

### Lamb Care

**Implementation:** `me.javavirtualenv.ecology.ai.EweProtectLambGoal`

Adult ewes protect and care for lambs with maternal behaviors.

**Behavior Details:**
- Protection radius: 24 blocks
- Move toward lamb if distance exceeds 8 blocks
- Detect when lamb is fleeing or hurt
- Protective response when lamb is threatened

**Lamb Danger Detection:**
- Lamb moving quickly (above 0.3 speed)
- Lamb health below 70%
- Ewe moves between threat and lamb

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "lamb_care": {
    "enabled": true,
    "follow_range": 24.0,
    "protection_range": 12.0,
    "speed_modifier": 1.0,
    "priority": 2
  }
}
```

### Sound Effects

Sheep use different vocalizations for communication:

| Context | Sound | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Eating | `SHEEP_EAT` | During grazing |
| Shearing | `SHEEP_SHEAR` | When sheared |
| Ambient | `SHEEP_AMBIENT` | General communication |
| Lamb care | `SHEEP_AMBIENT` | Higher pitch |
| Distress | `SHEEP_AMBIENT` | Higher pitch and volume |

## Integration

### Component System

Sheep behaviors integrate with the ecology component system:

```java
EcologyComponent component = sheep.getComponent();
CompoundTag woolTag = component.getHandleTag("wool");
int woolStage = woolTag.getInt("wool_stage");
float woolQuality = woolTag.getFloat("wool_quality");
```

### Hunger System

Wool growth depends on hunger:
- Requires hunger above 30% to grow
- Growth chance scales with hunger level
- Grazing restores 25 hunger points

### Condition System

Wool quality calculation:
- 30% from nutrition
- 30% from condition
- 20% from health percentage

### Social System

Separation distress affects social needs:
- Isolated sheep become lonely faster
- Social recovery when grouped

## NBT Data

Inspect sheep data using commands:

```
/data get entity @e[type=sheep,limit=1] better-ecology.wool
```

Expected output:
```
{
  wool_stage: 3,
  last_shear_time: 12345,
  wool_quality: 0.75,
  last_graze_time: 12350,
  grazing_count: 15
}
```

## Scientific Basis

### Wool Growth
Based on real sheep wool growth cycles where growth rate depends on nutrition (protein intake) and quality is affected by overall health.

### Flocking Behavior
Based on ungulate flocking research showing sheep are highly gregarious with strong separation anxiety when isolated.

### Lamb Care
Based on maternal behavior research in sheep, including strong mother-young bonding, recognition by sound and smell, and protective behaviors.
