| Health | 10 HP (5 hearts) |
| Social Type | Colony |
| Habitat | Near hives and flowers |
| Activity Pattern | Diurnal |

## Behaviors

### Foraging

Bees search for and collect nectar from flowers.

- Search patterns based on flower density
- Return to hive when full
- Share foraging information with hive

### Hive Dynamics

Bees maintain strong connections to their home hive.

- Return to hive at night
- Defend hive when threatened
- Multiple bees per hive

### Pollination

Bees pollinate crops as they forage.

- Transfer pollen between flowers
- Accelerate crop growth
- Flower preference patterns

### Defense

Bees defend their hive aggressively.

- Sting attack causes damage
- Bee dies after stinging
- Swarm response to threats

### Weather Response

- Stay in hive during rain
- Reduced activity at night
- Temperature affects activity level

## Scientific Basis

Based on honeybee foraging and hive behavior research.
