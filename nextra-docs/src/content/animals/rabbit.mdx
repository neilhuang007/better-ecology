## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 3 HP (1.5 hearts) |
| Movement Speed | 0.3 (fast) |
| Diet | Carrots, dandelions, golden carrots |
| Social Type | Colony animal |
| Prey Status | High vulnerability |

## Behaviors

### Fleeing Behavior

Rabbits have sophisticated escape mechanisms.

**Zigzag Evasion:**
- Unpredictable path changes during flight
- Protean movement to confuse predators
- Direction changes vary in intensity

**Freezing:**
- Initial freeze response before fleeing
- Assesses threat level while frozen
- Controlled by threat proximity

**Flight Initiation Distance:**
- High FID due to small size and vulnerability
- Earlier escape when refuge is farther
- Adjusts based on predator type

### Burrowing System

Rabbits seek and use burrows for safety.

**Burrow Detection:**
- Search for holes in terrain
- Natural cave entrances
- Underground spaces

**Burrow Behavior:**
- Run toward burrow when threatened
- Hide inside burrow
- Emerge cautiously after threat passes

### Alarm Signals

Rabbits warn colony members of threats.

**Thumping Warnings:**
- Rear foot thumping
- Alerts nearby rabbits
- Contagious alarming spreads through colony

**Visual Signals:**
- White tail flash when fleeing
- Alerts other rabbits to danger

### Food Caching

Rabbits may store food for later.

**Caching Behavior:**
- Store excess food items
- Return to caches when hungry
- Defend cache locations

## Escape Strategies

| Strategy | When Used |
|----------|-----------|
| Straight-line | Refuge nearby and accessible |
| Zigzag | Open terrain, cursorial predator |
| Freeze | Ambush predator detected |
| Burrow | Burrow within reach |

## Configuration

```json
{
  "fleeing": {
    "flightInitiationDistance": 16,
    "zigzagIntensity": 0.7,
    "freezingDuration": 40,
    "escapeStrategy": "ZIGZAG"
  }
}
```

## Scientific Basis

### Zigzag Evasion
Based on research on protean movement showing unpredictability correlates with evasion success.

### Thumping Behavior
Based on observed rabbit warning behaviors in wild populations.

### Freezing Response
Based on research on prey animal freeze responses to ambush predators.
