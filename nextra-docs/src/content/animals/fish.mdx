## Common Fish Behaviors

All fish in Better Ecology share these behaviors:

### Schooling

Fish form schools for protection.

- Separation, alignment, cohesion forces
- Group movement coordination
- Confusion effect against predators
- School size affects behavior

### Escape Waves

Fish schools react to threats with coordinated escape.

- Rapid coordinated scattering
- Flash expansion pattern
- Subcritical waves through school

## Cod

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 3 HP |
| Habitat | Cold ocean |
| School Size | Medium-large |

### Behaviors

- Form large schools
- Bottom-dwelling tendency
- Slow, steady movement

## Salmon

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 3 HP |
| Habitat | Rivers, cold ocean |
| Special | Upstream swimming |

### Behaviors

- River navigation
- Upstream migration patterns
- Spawning behavior in rivers
- Ocean to river transition

## Tropical Fish

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 3 HP |
| Habitat | Warm ocean, coral reefs |
| Variants | Many color patterns |

### Behaviors

- Reef association

- Tight schooling in reefs
- Hide in coral when threatened

## Pufferfish

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 3 HP |
| Habitat | Warm ocean |
| Special | Inflation defense |

### Behaviors

- Inflate when threatened
- Poison effect on contact when inflated
- Deflation over time
- Solitary or small groups

### Inflation States

| State | Size | Poison |
|-------|------|--------|
| Normal | Small | None |
| Semi-inflated | Medium | Moderate |
| Fully inflated | Large | Strong |

## Squid and Glow Squid
