## Behaviors

### Herding Behavior

Cows exhibit collective movement and decision-making as a herd.

**Quorum-Based Movement:**
- Movement typically initiated when threshold of herd joins
- Default quorum threshold: 0.3-0.7 (30-70% of herd)
- Democratic decision-making for direction

**Selfish Herd Positioning:**
- Weaker/younger animals seek center positions
- Peripheral positions have higher predation risk
- Dynamic repositioning based on threat detection

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "quorumThreshold": 0.5,
  "leadershipAgeBonus": 0.3,
  "separationDistance": 2.0,
  "cohesionDistance": 12.0
}
```

### Grazing Patterns

Cows follow bimodal grazing patterns throughout the day.

**Grazing Schedule:**
- Morning grazing period
- Afternoon grazing period
- Resting periods between grazing

**Grazing Behavior:**
- Seek grass blocks within range
- Consume grass to restore hunger
- Move to new patches when current depleted

### Vigilance Behavior

Cows take turns being alert while others feed.

**Many-Eyes Effect:**
- Larger groups detect predators earlier
- Shared vigilance reduces individual scanning time
- Edge individuals maintain higher vigilance

### Maternal Behavior

Adult cows protect and care for calves.

**Protection Behavior:**
- Stay within range of calves
- Move between threat and calf
- Increase vigilance when calf present

**Following Behavior:**
- Calves follow mother closely
- Separation triggers distress
- Mother waits for separated calves

## Hunger System

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum | 100 |
| Starting | 75 |
| Decay Rate | Moderate |
| Grazing Restoration | Variable based on grass quality |

## Social System

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Herd Size Preference | 4-12 individuals |
| Cohesion Radius | 12 blocks |
| Separation Distance | 2 blocks |

## Configuration

Cow behaviors are configured via JSON files in:
```
data/better-ecology/mobs/passive/cow.json
```

## Scientific Basis

### Collective Decision-Making
Based on research showing neither age nor dominance consistently influence movement order in cattle, with democratic consensus observed in herds.

### Grazing Patterns
Based on bimodal grazing research showing morning and afternoon activity peaks.

### Vigilance
Based on research on shared vigilance and the many-eyes effect in ungulate herds.
