## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Health | 6 HP (3 hearts) |
| Movement | Flying |
| Activity Pattern | Crepuscular/Nocturnal |
| Social Type | Colonial roosting |

## Behaviors

### Crepuscular Emergence

Bats emerge from roosts based on light conditions.

**Emergence Triggers:**
- Light level drops below threshold
- Time of day (dusk)
- Weather conditions (overcast days may trigger early emergence)

**Dawn Return:**
- Return to roost before sunrise
- Seek dark enclosed spaces
- Avoid light exposure

### Roosting Behavior

Bats cluster on ceilings and in dark spaces.

**Roost Preferences:**
- Ceilings of caves
- Dark enclosed spaces
- Protected from weather

**Roost Clustering:**
- Group together on roost surfaces
- Maintain colony cohesion
- Share warmth in groups

### Group Emergence

Bats emerge from roosts as a group.

**Emergence Pattern:**
- Group emergence timing
- Social cues trigger departure
- Coordinated flight patterns

### Foraging Patterns

Bats forage for insects during activity periods.

**Foraging Behavior:**
- Seek flying insects
- Navigate using environment awareness
- Return to roost when satiated

## Activity Cycle

| Time | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Day | Roosting in dark spaces |
| Dusk | Emergence and foraging |
| Night | Active foraging |
| Dawn | Return to roost |

## Light Response

| Light Level | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| 0-4 | Active, comfortable |
| 5-7 | Active but seeking shade |
| 8-11 | Returning to roost |
| 12-15 | Roosting, hiding |

## Configuration

Bat behaviors are configured via JSON files with parameters for:
- Emergence light threshold
- Roosting preferences
- Foraging patterns
- Group behavior

## Scientific Basis

### Emergence Timing
Based on research showing bat emergence is triggered by declining light levels rather than absolute time.

### Roosting Behavior
Based on observations of bat colony behavior and roost site selection.

### Predation Avoidance
Based on research on bat timing to avoid diurnal predators.
