## Behaviors

### Flocking Behavior

Chickens exhibit flocking behaviors similar to other birds.

**Boids Algorithm:**
- Separation: Avoid crowding neighbors
- Alignment: Steer toward average heading
- Cohesion: Move toward average position

**Topological Neighbors:**
- Track 6-7 nearest neighbors
- Respond to fixed number of neighbors rather than distance

### Foraging

Chickens actively search for food.

**Seed Finding:**
- Search for seeds on ground
- Peck at ground to find food
- Compete with other chickens for resources

**Ground Scratching:**
- Scratch at dirt/grass blocks
- May find seeds or insects
- Natural foraging behavior

### Alarm Responses

Chickens respond to threats with alarm behaviors.

**Alarm Behaviors:**
- Flap upward when threatened
- Alert nearby chickens
- Scatter when predator detected

### Nesting

Chickens seek appropriate nesting locations.

**Nest Preferences:**
- Enclosed spaces
- Hay bale blocks
- Protected from weather

## Fleeing Behavior

Chickens flee from threats with specific patterns.

**Flight Response:**
- Immediate flapping upward
- Scatter pattern
- Group alarm signals

## Scientific Basis

### Flocking
Based on the boids algorithm and research on bird flocking behavior.

### Foraging
Based on natural chicken foraging patterns including ground scratching.

### Alarm Responses
Based on research on bird alarm calls and group responses.
