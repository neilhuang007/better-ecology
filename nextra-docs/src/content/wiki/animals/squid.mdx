# Squid

Beneath the ocean waves, these eight-armed wanderers drift through the currents, masters of escape and illusion. When danger approaches, they leave behind only darkness and mystery.

## Overview

Squids are passive aquatic creatures that inhabit the ocean depths and flowing rivers. While they pose no direct threat to players, their unique defensive capabilities make them fascinating to observe and occasionally challenging to catch.

## Behavior & Ecology

### Social Swimming

Did you know that squids rarely travel alone? Watch the ocean waters carefully and you'll often spot them moving in loose groups, their tentacles trailing as they pulse through the currents. These gatherings aren't just for show - swimming together helps them navigate the vast ocean expanse.

### Ink Cloud Defense

Try approaching a squid too quickly and witness their signature defense mechanism. When threatened, squids release a thick cloud of dark ink into the water, obscuring vision and creating the perfect opportunity for escape. This ink isn't just for show - it can completely blind predators and players alike, giving the squid precious seconds to vanish into the depths.

**Tip:** If you're hunting squids for their ink sacs, be patient. Rushing in will only result in a face full of ink and an empty inventory.

### The Glowing Mystery

In the darkest ocean trenches, you might encounter something extraordinary - the glow squid. These luminescent variants emit a soft, hypnotic light as they drift through the abyss. They share the same defensive instincts as their common cousins but drop the rare glow ink sac, prized for its unique properties.

## Where to Find Them

Squids make their home in:
- **Ocean biomes** - The most common habitat, from warm tropical waters to frozen seas
- **Rivers** - Occasionally found in deeper river sections
- **Deep ocean trenches** - Where glow squids prefer to dwell

**Tip:** Listen for the subtle sound of water displacement. Squids often give away their presence before you spot them in murky waters.

## Player Interaction

### Harvesting Ink

Squids drop ink sacs upon death, essential ingredients for:
- Black dye for wool, concrete, and banners
- Book and quill crafting
- Various decorative applications

Glow squids provide glow ink sacs, which create:
- Glowing item frames
- Illuminated signs
- Special visual effects

### Hunting Strategy

Try these approaches when hunting squids:

1. **The Patient Approach** - Wait underwater with a trident or bow, letting squids drift into range
2. **The Net Method** - Use water currents to guide squids into confined spaces where ink clouds matter less
3. **The Swift Strike** - Attack decisively before they can release their defensive cloud

**Did you know?** Squids are sensitive to sudden movements. Slow, deliberate approaches work better than frantic chasing.

## Ecological Role

Squids serve as:
- **Prey species** - Food source for dolphins and drowned
- **Ink producers** - Natural source of valuable dyes
- **Ocean ambiance** - Their presence brings life to otherwise empty waters

## Observations from the Deep

Players have reported fascinating squid behaviors:
- Squids sometimes swim in synchronized patterns, pulsing through the water in mesmerizing formations
- The ink clouds they produce vary in density - more frightened squids create thicker, longer-lasting clouds
- Glow squids seem to be attracted to complete darkness, rarely venturing into well-lit waters

**Tip:** Build an underwater observation post with glass walls to watch squid behavior without disturbing them. Their natural patterns emerge when they don't perceive threats.

## Survival Notes

- Squids cannot survive on land - they suffocate quickly if beached
- They're harmless to players but their ink clouds can disorient you during ocean exploration
- A single squid farm can provide endless dye resources for your building projects
- Glow squids are rarer than common squids - treasure their drops accordingly
