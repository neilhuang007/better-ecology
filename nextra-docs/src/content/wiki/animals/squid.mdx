Beneath the ocean waves, these eight-armed wanderers drift through the currents, masters of escape and illusion. When danger approaches, they leave behind only darkness and mystery.

## Social Swimming

Squids rarely travel alone. Watch the ocean waters carefully and you'll often spot them moving in loose groups, their tentacles trailing as they pulse through the currents. These gatherings aren't just for show - swimming together helps them navigate the vast ocean expanse.

## Ink Cloud Defense

When threatened, squids release a thick cloud of dark ink into the water, obscuring vision and creating the perfect opportunity for escape. This ink can completely blind predators and players alike, giving the squid precious seconds to vanish into the depths.

Rushing squids gets you a face full of ink and empty pockets!

## The Glowing Mystery

In the darkest ocean trenches, you might encounter something extraordinary - the glow squid. These luminescent variants emit a soft, hypnotic light as they drift through the abyss. They share the same defensive instincts as their common cousins but drop the rare glow ink sac, prized for its unique properties.

## Where to Find Them

Squids make their home in various water bodies:

**Ocean biomes** - The most common habitat, from warm tropical waters to frozen seas

**Rivers** - Occasionally found in deeper river sections

**Deep ocean trenches** - Where glow squids prefer to dwell

## Harvesting Ink

Squids drop ink sacs upon death, essential ingredients for:
- Black dye for wool, concrete, and banners
- Book and quill crafting
- Various decorative applications

Glow squids provide glow ink sacs, which create:
- Glowing item frames
- Illuminated signs
- Special visual effects

## Hunting Strategy

</HintBox>

## Ecological Role

Squids serve as:
- **Prey species** - Food source for dolphins and drowned
- **Ink producers** - Natural source of valuable dyes
- **Ocean ambiance** - Their presence brings life to otherwise empty waters

## Observations from the Deep

Squids sometimes swim in synchronized patterns, pulsing through the water in mesmerizing formations. The ink clouds they produce vary in density based on how threatened they feel.

## Survival Notes

- Squids cannot survive on land - they suffocate quickly if beached
- They're harmless to players but their ink clouds can disorient you during ocean exploration
- A single squid farm can provide endless dye resources for your building projects
- Glow squids are rarer than common squids - treasure their drops accordingly
