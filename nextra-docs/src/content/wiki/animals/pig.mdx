Pigs are one of the most delightful animals to observe in Better Ecology! These curious creatures bring life to your world with their love of rooting, rolling in mud, and socializing with their piggy friends.

## What Makes Pigs Special?

### Rooting and Foraging

Pigs absolutely love digging around in the ground! You'll often see them rooting through dirt and grass blocks, snuffling around as they search for tasty morsels. This isn't just for show - pigs are natural foragers and will happily munch on crops, carrots, potatoes, and almost anything edible they come across.

Pigs might dig up surprises while rooting! Keep an eye on what they find - you never know when they might uncover a truffle or other goodies.

### Mud Bathing Behavior

Did you know pigs are actually very clean? The mud helps them cool down! Pigs don't sweat like humans do, so they seek out water and mud to regulate their body temperature. Watch as they enthusiastically roll around in muddy areas - it's both practical and adorable.

<HintBox type="experiment">
Make a mud pit near your pig pen by placing water blocks next to dirt. Watch them enjoy it! Your pigs will be much happier with a designated mud bath area.

### Social Creatures

Pigs are surprisingly social animals. They prefer being around other pigs and will often stay close to their herd. You'll notice they're calmer and more content when they have piggy companions nearby.

### Family Bonds

Piglets have a special bond with their mothers! You'll see baby pigs following their mothers closely, staying near for protection and guidance. It's heartwarming to watch a mother pig lead her little ones around while they explore the world together.

## Living with Pigs

### Feeding

Pigs eat almost anything, but they especially love carrots! You can also feed them:
- Potatoes
- Beetroots
- Various crops

Their omnivorous nature makes them easy to keep fed, and they'll happily clean up any food lying around.

### Creating the Perfect Pig Habitat

Want happy pigs? Here's what they love:

1. **Mud Pit:** A shallow water source near dirt blocks creates the perfect mud bath
2. **Space to Roam:** Give them room to root around and explore
3. **Company:** Keep at least 2-3 pigs together so they can socialize
4. **Food Sources:** Plant a carrot patch nearby for easy feeding

<HintBox type="info">
Pigs are happiest when they can express their natural behaviors - rooting, mud bathing, and socializing. A well-designed pen that supports these behaviors will keep your pigs content!

## Fun Activities with Pigs

### Truffle Hunting

Set up a rooting area and watch your pigs work! Their natural digging behavior means they might just find valuable truffles or other hidden treasures while they root around.

### Breeding

Feed two pigs their favorite food (carrots work great!) and you'll soon have adorable piglets running around. Watch as the mother pig takes care of her young - it's a beautiful example of natural parenting behavior.

### Observation

Sometimes the best activity is simply watching! Pigs have so many interesting behaviors:
- Watch them snuffle and root through the ground
- See them race to their mud pit on a hot day
- Observe how they interact with their herd
- Notice how piglets stay close to their mothers

<HintBox type="tip">
Try building a viewing platform above your pig pen. You'll get a great view of all their natural behaviors without disturbing them!

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my pig digging up my grass?**
A: That's natural rooting behavior! Pigs love to dig. You might want to give them a dedicated rooting area away from your landscaping.

**Q: How do I keep pigs cool?**
A: Pigs need access to water or mud to stay cool. Make sure they have a mud bath available, especially in warmer biomes.

**Q: Will pigs eat my crops?**
A: Yes! Pigs are opportunistic eaters and will munch on nearby crops. Consider fencing your gardens separately from your pig pen.

**Q: How many pigs should I keep together?**
A: Pigs are social, so keep at least 2-3 together. They'll be happier with companions!
