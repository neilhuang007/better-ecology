## Behavior

Sheep are natural flock animals who find comfort in numbers. These fluffy friends don't just randomly wander - they move together with purpose, following leaders and sticking close to their companions. Watch a flock for a few minutes and you'll see a fascinating social dynamic unfold!

### The Flock Dynamic

Not all sheep are created equal! In every flock, certain sheep are naturally braver and more confident. These leaders are the first to move to new grazing spots, and the rest of the flock follows their lead. It's like they're having a silent conversation!

<HintBox type="observation">
Watch from a distance and see if you can spot the leader. Look for the sheep that moves first when the flock relocates.
</HintBox>

When enough sheep in the flock start moving in one direction, the others follow along. But it's not instant - watch closely and you'll see hesitant sheep looking around at their neighbors before deciding to join the movement. It's group decision-making in action!

<HintBox type="info">
Sheep vote with their feet! When enough of the group moves, the rest follow. This is called the quorum threshold.
</HintBox>

### Grazing Together

Sheep don't just eat grass randomly - they graze as a coordinated group! When one sheep finds a good patch of grass, others nearby take notice and join in. You might see the whole flock slowly drifting across a meadow, munching as they go.

<HintBox type="mechanics">
After sheep graze on grass blocks, their wool grows back naturally over time. Watch a recently sheared sheep and you'll see it get fluffy again!
</HintBox>

### Fleeing from Danger

When wolves appear, sheep know exactly what to do - run! But they don't scatter in all directions like you might expect. Instead, they try to stick together even while fleeing. Safety in numbers is the sheep's motto, even in moments of panic.

<HintBox type="observation">
When a wolf approaches, the whole flock reacts! Even sheep who didn't directly see the wolf will start fleeing because their neighbors are fleeing. It's a wave of panic that spreads through the group.
</HintBox>

## Lambs

Baby sheep (lambs) are adorable bundles of wool with their own unique behaviors!

### Following Mother

Lambs stick close to their mothers like glue! You'll see them trailing behind their mom as she grazes, mimicking her movements. If the mother moves to a new spot, the lamb is right there with her.

### Curious Nature

While adult sheep are cautious, lambs have that youthful boldness. They might come investigate you more readily than adult sheep, hopping around and exploring their world. But don't worry - if they get scared, they'll run right back to mom's side.

<HintBox type="info">
Lambs grow into adult sheep over time, and when they do, they'll develop their own personality. Some might become brave leaders, while others prefer to be followers!
</HintBox>

## Personality Differences

Here's something magical - not all sheep are the same! Some sheep are naturally braver than others. You might notice certain sheep are always at the front of the flock, leading the way to new areas. Meanwhile, other sheep hang back, preferring to follow rather than lead.

<HintBox type="experiment">
Find a flock of sheep and watch them for a few minutes without interfering. See which sheep move first when the flock relocates. Those early movers? Those are your natural leaders!
</HintBox>

## Living with Sheep

### Creating a Sheep Farm

Sheep are easier to manage than you might think! Because they naturally flock together, keeping a group of sheep in a pasture means they'll mostly stay together on their own. Build a nice big pen with plenty of grass and watch them form their own little society.

<HintBox type="tip">
Plant a big grassy area in your sheep pen. Sheep will graze on the grass blocks, and their wool will slowly regrow. It's a natural, sustainable system!
</HintBox>

### Breeding Sheep

Sheep love wheat! Hold some wheat and they'll follow you (though not as enthusiastically as cows). Right-click two sheep with wheat and they'll produce a lamb.

<HintBox type="mechanics">
The lamb will stay close to its mother at first. Give them space to bond and watch the adorable family dynamics unfold!
</HintBox>

### Wool Collection

You can shear sheep for wool without hurting them - they'll just look a bit silly until their wool grows back! Sheep naturally regrow wool over time as they graze on grass, so your flock is a renewable wool source.

## Survival Tips

<HintBox type="warning">
Protect from wolves! Sheep are terrified of wolves (and rightfully so). If you're keeping sheep as livestock, light up the area and build secure fencing to keep predators out.
</HintBox>

- Give them space - A cramped flock is a stressed flock. Sheep like to move around together, so bigger pastures make for happier sheep.

- Watch the leaders - If you need to move a flock, identify the natural leaders and guide them. The rest will follow!

- Grass is essential - Sheep need grass to regrow their wool. Dirt or stone pens won't work well for sustainable wool farming.

## Observing Sheep Behavior

### Best Viewing Tips

<HintBox type="observation">
Stay at a distance - sheep are more natural when they don't feel threatened by you. Watch at dawn when flocks are most active!
</HintBox>

1. Look for the leader - one sheep usually initiates movement
2. Count how many follow - not all sheep follow immediately
3. Notice the stragglers - the most cautious sheep are always last to move

### What to Watch For

- Group cohesion - How close do sheep stay to each other?
- Leadership patterns - Does the same sheep always lead?
- Grazing coordination - Do they eat in the same area together?
- Panic responses - How does fear spread through the flock?
- Mother-lamb bonds - How close do lambs stay to their mothers?

## Fun Facts

- Sheep remember locations! If they find a particularly nice grazing spot, they might return to it later
- The bravest sheep in a flock influences where the whole group goes
- Lambs learn behaviors by watching their mothers - it's sheep education!
- When one sheep jumps, others nearby might jump too - peer pressure is real!
- Sheep can recognize individual sheep in their flock and prefer familiar faces

<HintBox type="info">
Sheep are much smarter and more social than they might seem at first glance. Watch them long enough and you'll see the hidden intelligence in their flock behavior. Every sheep has a role to play in the group's survival!
</HintBox>
