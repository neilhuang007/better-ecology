## Behavior

Sheep are natural flock animals who find comfort in numbers. These fluffy friends don't just randomly wander - they move together with purpose, following leaders and sticking close to their companions. Watch a flock for a few minutes and you'll see a fascinating social dynamic unfold!

### The Flock Dynamic

Not all sheep are created equal! In every flock, certain sheep are naturally braver and more confident. These leaders are the first to move to new grazing spots, and the rest of the flock follows their lead. It's like they're having a silent conversation!

When enough sheep in the flock start moving in one direction, the others follow along. But it's not instant - watch closely and you'll see hesitant sheep looking around at their neighbors before deciding to join the movement. It's group decision-making in action!

Each sheep has a hidden bravery stat... some are born leaders, others prefer to follow.

### Grazing Together

Sheep don't just eat grass randomly - they graze as a coordinated group! When one sheep finds a good patch of grass, others nearby take notice and join in. You might see the whole flock slowly drifting across a meadow, munching as they go.

### Fleeing from Danger

When wolves appear, sheep know exactly what to do - run! But they don't scatter in all directions like you might expect. Instead, they try to stick together even while fleeing. Safety in numbers is the sheep's motto, even in moments of panic.

## Lambs

Baby sheep (lambs) are adorable bundles of wool with their own unique behaviors!

### Following Mother

Lambs stick close to their mothers like glue! You'll see them trailing behind their mom as she grazes, mimicking her movements. If the mother moves to a new spot, the lamb is right there with her.

### Curious Nature

While adult sheep are cautious, lambs have that youthful boldness. They might come investigate you more readily than adult sheep, hopping around and exploring their world. But don't worry - if they get scared, they'll run right back to mom's side.

## Personality Differences

Here's something magical - not all sheep are the same! Some sheep are naturally braver than others. You might notice certain sheep are always at the front of the flock, leading the way to new areas. Meanwhile, other sheep hang back, preferring to follow rather than lead.

## Living with Sheep

### Creating a Sheep Farm

Sheep are easier to manage than you might think! Because they naturally flock together, keeping a group of sheep in a pasture means they'll mostly stay together on their own. Build a nice big pen with plenty of grass and watch them form their own little society.

### Breeding Sheep

Sheep love wheat! Hold some wheat and they'll follow you (though not as enthusiastically as cows). Right-click two sheep with wheat and they'll produce a lamb.

### Wool Collection

You can shear sheep for wool without hurting them - they'll just look a bit silly until their wool grows back! Sheep naturally regrow wool over time as they graze on grass, so your flock is a renewable wool source.

## Survival Tips

- Protect from wolves! Sheep are terrified of wolves (and rightfully so). If you're keeping sheep as livestock, light up the area and build secure fencing to keep predators out.

- Give them space - A cramped flock is a stressed flock. Sheep like to move around together, so bigger pastures make for happier sheep.

- Watch the leaders - If you need to move a flock, identify the natural leaders and guide them. The rest will follow!

- Grass is essential - Sheep need grass to regrow their wool. Dirt or stone pens won't work well for sustainable wool farming.

## Observing Sheep Behavior

### Best Viewing Tips

1. Look for the leader - one sheep usually initiates movement
2. Count how many follow - not all sheep follow immediately
3. Notice the stragglers - the most cautious sheep are always last to move

### What to Watch For

- Group cohesion - How close do sheep stay to each other?
- Leadership patterns - Does the same sheep always lead?
- Grazing coordination - Do they eat in the same area together?
- Panic responses - How does fear spread through the flock?
- Mother-lamb bonds - How close do lambs stay to their mothers?

## Fun Facts

- Sheep remember locations! If they find a particularly nice grazing spot, they might return to it later
- The bravest sheep in a flock influences where the whole group goes
- Lambs learn behaviors by watching their mothers - it's sheep education!
- When one sheep jumps, others nearby might jump too - peer pressure is real!
- Sheep can recognize individual sheep in their flock and prefer familiar faces
