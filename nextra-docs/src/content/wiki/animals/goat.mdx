## Behavior

Goats are the daredevils of the Minecraft world! These fearless climbers treat steep mountain cliffs like gentle slopes, leaping to heights that would terrify other animals. If you think rabbits can jump, wait until you see a goat in action!

### Master Climbers

**Try following a goat up a mountain** - you'll struggle to keep up! Goats are expert mountaineers who navigate treacherous terrain with ease. They'll scale steep cliffsides, leap across dangerous gaps, and perch on narrow ledges like it's nothing. Watch them long enough and you'll see them reach places you thought were impossible for mobs to access.

**Did you know goats can jump 10 blocks high?** That's right - TEN BLOCKS! This incredible jumping ability lets them navigate mountain peaks that other animals can't reach. They use this skill constantly, bouncing up cliff faces and soaring across ravines like it's a casual stroll.

### Ramming Behavior

**Watch out - goats randomly ram things!** This is where goats get really interesting (and dangerous). Every so often, a goat will lower its head, build up speed, and WHAM - charge straight into whatever's nearby. That could be another mob, a block, or even YOU!

**What happens when they ram?**
- They charge with surprising speed
- Impact is strong enough to knock back most mobs
- When they hit solid blocks, they might drop their horns
- The ramming seems random - goats don't need a reason to headbutt things!

**Tip:** Keep your distance from goats if you're near cliff edges. A well-timed ram can send you flying off a mountain!

### Screaming Goats

**Listen carefully - some goats sound different!** Among regular goats, you'll occasionally find a screaming goat. These rare variants are louder, more aggressive, and ram more frequently than their quieter cousins. When you hear that distinctive screaming bleat, you know you've found a special one!

**Screaming goats are EXTRA aggressive** with their ramming. They charge more often and seem to have less patience than regular goats. Approach with caution!

## Baby Goats (Kids)

### Following Parents

**Kids stick with mom and dad on climbing adventures!** Baby goats learn mountaineering from their parents, following them up steep terrain and mimicking their incredible jumps. It's adorable to watch a tiny kid attempt the same gravity-defying leaps as its parents.

### Learning to Ram

**Young goats practice their ramming technique too!** While they're not as powerful as adult goats, kids will still occasionally charge at things. Think of it as ramming practice - they're learning the family tradition!

**Did you know?** Kids grow up to become either regular goats or screaming goats, inheriting their personality from birth. A screaming kid will always become a screaming adult!

## Goat Horns

### Collecting Horns

**This is how you get goat horns** - let the goat do the work! When a goat rams into a solid block (like stone, logs, or packed ice), there's a chance it will drop one of its horns. Each goat can drop up to two horns total.

**Try setting up ramming targets!** Build a wall of solid blocks in an area where goats roam. Eventually, their natural ramming behavior will cause them to charge the wall, and you might collect some horns!

### Horn Sounds

Each goat horn plays a unique sound when used. There are different varieties based on which goat dropped it and when. Collect them all to build your own mountain horn collection!

## Mountain Life

### Natural Habitat

**Goats spawn in mountain biomes** - the higher and steeper, the better! You'll find them on:
- Jagged peaks
- Frozen peaks
- Snowy slopes

These high-altitude homes are perfect for goats because their climbing and jumping abilities are actually useful here. While other mobs struggle with the terrain, goats thrive!

### Survival Adaptations

**Goats are built for extreme environments.** They handle cold weather without issue and navigate dangerous terrain that would kill most other passive mobs. Their incredible jump height isn't just for show - it's essential for mountain survival.

## Living with Goats

### Creating a Goat Enclosure

**Building a goat pen is challenging!** Remember these points:
- Fences need to be VERY tall - goats can jump 10 blocks
- Solid walls work better than fences
- Give them plenty of space to jump around
- Expect them to ram your walls occasionally
- Keep valuable items away from the pen (ramming can be destructive!)

### Breeding Goats

Goats love wheat! Hold wheat near them and they'll follow you (though they might still ram you occasionally - it's just their nature). Right-click two goats with wheat to breed them.

**Remember:** Screaming goats can breed with regular goats, and the baby has a chance to be either type. It's like a personality lottery!

### Farming Goat Horns

Want to collect all the horn varieties? Keep your goats well-fed and happy in an enclosure with solid blocks they can ram. Over time, you'll collect horns as they go about their ramming business. Just be patient - and stay out of the ramming path!

## Survival Tips

- **Respect the ram!** Don't stand directly in front of a goat that's lowering its head. That's the warning sign it's about to charge.

- **Cliff edges are deadly** - A goat ram near a steep drop can send you plummeting. Watch your positioning in mountain biomes.

- **They can't be tamed** - Goats will always be a bit wild and unpredictable. Even bred goats will ram things randomly.

- **Screaming goats are trophies** - Their rarity makes them special. If you find one, consider keeping it safe (in a VERY secure pen).

- **Use their jumping against them** - Need to trap a goat? Deep pits work better than tall fences since they can jump OUT but not necessarily UP from a deep hole.

## Observing Goat Behavior

### Best Viewing Tips

1. **Watch from a safe distance** - Far enough to avoid random rams
2. **Visit mountain peaks** - That's where goats show off their best skills
3. **Listen for screaming** - Helps you identify rare screaming goats
4. **Observe ramming patterns** - How often do they charge? What triggers it?
5. **Track their climbing routes** - Where do they like to go?

### What to Watch For

- **Jump height demonstrations** - See them scale impossible cliffs
- **Ramming frequency** - Regular vs screaming goat behavior differences
- **Parent-kid interactions** - How do adults teach kids to climb?
- **Territorial behavior** - Do goats claim specific mountain areas?
- **Horn drops** - Witness the moment they lose a horn!

## Fun Facts

- Goats can jump higher than any other passive mob in Minecraft
- Screaming goats are inspired by real fainting goats (but these don't faint!)
- A single goat ram can knock you back several blocks
- Kids follow their parents on climbing expeditions, learning the routes
- Goats don't take fall damage easily - they're built for mountain leaping
- Each goat can only drop 2 horns maximum in its lifetime

*Remember: Goats are wild-spirited mountaineers that value freedom and altitude. They're not meant to be docile farm animals - they're adventurous climbers with a penchant for headbutting. Respect their space, admire their jumping skills, and maybe duck when they lower their head!*
