Witness one of nature's most incredible journeys right in your Minecraft world. Salmon are remarkable fish that undertake epic migrations, swimming against powerful currents and leaping up waterfalls to reach their destination.

## The Great Migration

Salmon are born with an incredible instinct - they must swim upstream. Watch closely and you'll see salmon actively fighting against river currents, determinedly heading toward the source of the water. This isn't random wandering - it's a purposeful journey hardcoded into their very nature.


## Masters of the Leap

Here's where salmon truly shine - they can jump up waterfalls. When a salmon encounters flowing water dropping down, it doesn't turn back. Instead, it gathers its strength and launches itself upward, attempting to clear the obstacle.

## Swimming in Schools

Safety in numbers isn't just a saying - it's survival strategy for salmon. These fish naturally gather into schools, swimming together in coordinated groups.


## Where to Find Them

Salmon have specific habitat preferences - they're creatures of cold water:

**Cold Ocean Biomes** - Large schools swimming near the surface, moving between kelp forests and open water.

**Rivers (especially cold rivers)** - Smaller groups pushing upstream against the current.

**River Mouths** - The junction between ocean and river is prime salmon territory. Schools gather here, preparing to begin their upstream migration.

**Deep Ocean Waters** - Less common, but salmon occasionally venture into deeper ocean zones while staying in colder waters.

## Size Variations

Not all salmon are created equal. You'll encounter different sizes as you explore:

- **Small Salmon** - Young fish, still learning the ways of the water. These stick especially close to their schools.
- **Medium Salmon** - The most common size - healthy adult fish in their prime.
- **Large Salmon** - Impressive specimens that have survived many challenges. These often lead schools.

## Predators and Survival

Life isn't easy for salmon. They face numerous threats and are always alert, ready to scatter at the first sign of danger.

**Bears** are the salmon's primary natural enemy. When a bear appears near a river, watch how quickly salmon react - they'll dart away to safer waters.

### Escape Tactics

When threatened, salmon employ several survival strategies:
- **Burst Swimming** - Sudden bursts of speed to create distance from predators
- **School Scattering** - The school explodes in different directions, confusing attackers
- **Deep Diving** - Heading to deeper water where some predators can't follow
- **Current Riding** - Using water flow to quickly move away from danger

## Important Food Source

Salmon are a crucial part of the food chain:

- **Nutrition for Predators** - Bears especially rely on salmon as a primary food source
- **Food for Players** - Raw salmon can be cooked for a reliable food source
- **Bone Meal** - When processed, salmon yield bone meal for crop growth

## Observing Salmon Behavior

Watch for school coordination and synchronized movements, jump attempts at waterfalls (some succeed on first try, others need multiple attempts), and current fighting as salmon angle their bodies upstream.

## Conservation Tips

Want to maintain a healthy salmon population?

- **Preserve Natural Rivers** - Avoid damming or dramatically altering river courses
- **Create Fish Ladders** - Include stepped pools or gradual slopes salmon can navigate
- **Protect Spawning Areas** - Keep upstream river sections pristine
- **Limit Predator Pressure** - Balance is key to preventing population depletion

## Common Questions

**Q: Why do salmon keep swimming against the current?**
That's their natural migration behavior. Salmon are hardwired to swim upstream - it's one of nature's most amazing instincts.

**Q: Can salmon survive jumping any height waterfall?**
Salmon can attempt impressive jumps, but extremely tall waterfalls (4+ blocks) become very challenging. They're persistent though.

**Q: Do salmon ever swim downstream?**
While their primary drive is upstream, salmon will move around locally and may drift downstream if resting or fleeing predators.
