Witness one of nature's most incredible journeys right in your Minecraft world. Salmon are remarkable fish that undertake epic migrations, swimming against powerful currents and leaping up waterfalls to reach their destination.

## The Great Migration

Salmon are born with an incredible instinct - they must swim upstream. Watch closely and you'll see salmon actively fighting against river currents, determinedly heading toward the source of the water. This isn't random wandering - it's a purposeful journey hardcoded into their very nature.

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
In the real world, salmon migrate hundreds of miles upstream to spawn. In Better Ecology, you can witness this same ancient drive as they navigate your river systems.
</HintBox>

## Masters of the Leap

Here's where salmon truly shine - they can jump up waterfalls. When a salmon encounters flowing water dropping down, it doesn't turn back. Instead, it gathers its strength and launches itself upward, attempting to clear the obstacle.

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Build a multi-level waterfall in a cold river biome and watch salmon navigate it. They'll work their way up level by level, jumping each cascade. Some might need multiple attempts.
</HintBox>

<HintBox type="observation">
Stand near a waterfall in a cold river and watch for these spectacular leaps. You might see several salmon attempting the same jump, one after another, as they work their way upstream.
</HintBox>

## Swimming in Schools

Safety in numbers isn't just a saying - it's survival strategy for salmon. These fish naturally gather into schools, swimming together in coordinated groups.

<HintBox type="tip">
Schools of 5-8 salmon create the most impressive displays. Look for these larger groups in ocean biomes and at river mouths where multiple salmon gather before beginning their upstream journey.
</HintBox>

Watch a school move through the water and you'll notice they maintain formation, turning and moving as a unified group. When one salmon changes direction, others nearby often follow, creating beautiful flowing patterns.

## Where to Find Them

Salmon have specific habitat preferences - they're creatures of cold water:

**Cold Ocean Biomes** - Large schools swimming near the surface, moving between kelp forests and open water.

**Rivers (especially cold rivers)** - Smaller groups pushing upstream against the current.

**River Mouths** - The junction between ocean and river is prime salmon territory. Schools gather here, preparing to begin their upstream migration.

**Deep Ocean Waters** - Less common, but salmon occasionally venture into deeper ocean zones while staying in colder waters.

## Size Variations

Not all salmon are created equal. You'll encounter different sizes as you explore:

- **Small Salmon** - Young fish, still learning the ways of the water. These stick especially close to their schools.
- **Medium Salmon** - The most common size - healthy adult fish in their prime.
- **Large Salmon** - Impressive specimens that have survived many challenges. These often lead schools.

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Larger salmon can make slightly higher jumps when navigating waterfalls. Watch for the big ones to succeed where smaller fish struggle.
</HintBox>

## Predators and Survival

Life isn't easy for salmon. They face numerous threats and are always alert, ready to scatter at the first sign of danger.

**Bears** are the salmon's primary natural enemy. When a bear appears near a river, watch how quickly salmon react - they'll dart away to safer waters.

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Observe a river with both salmon and a bear. You'll witness a tense game of cat-and-mouse as salmon try to navigate upstream while avoiding becoming a meal.
</HintBox>

### Escape Tactics

When threatened, salmon employ several survival strategies:
- **Burst Swimming** - Sudden bursts of speed to create distance from predators
- **School Scattering** - The school explodes in different directions, confusing attackers
- **Deep Diving** - Heading to deeper water where some predators can't follow
- **Current Riding** - Using water flow to quickly move away from danger

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
A salmon's best defense is its school. Predators have a harder time targeting one fish among many, so staying grouped improves everyone's chances of survival.
</HintBox>

## Important Food Source

Salmon are a crucial part of the food chain:

- **Nutrition for Predators** - Bears especially rely on salmon as a primary food source
- **Food for Players** - Raw salmon can be cooked for a reliable food source
- **Bone Meal** - When processed, salmon yield bone meal for crop growth

<HintBox type="tip">
If you're planning a bear habitat or wildlife preserve, include a river with salmon. The bears will naturally hunt them, creating authentic ecosystem interactions.
</HintBox>

## Observing Salmon Behavior

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Build an underwater viewing chamber or riverside observation platform. Watch for:
- School coordination and synchronized movements
- Jump attempts at waterfalls (some succeed on first try, others need multiple attempts)
- Current fighting as salmon angle their bodies upstream
</HintBox>

## Conservation Tips

Want to maintain a healthy salmon population?

- **Preserve Natural Rivers** - Avoid damming or dramatically altering river courses
- **Create Fish Ladders** - Include stepped pools or gradual slopes salmon can navigate
- **Protect Spawning Areas** - Keep upstream river sections pristine
- **Limit Predator Pressure** - Balance is key to preventing population depletion

<HintBox type="mechanics">
Salmon populations need time to recover from fishing pressure. Don't overfish a single area if you want them around for future fishing and viewing.
</HintBox>

## Common Questions

**Q: Why do salmon keep swimming against the current?**
That's their natural migration behavior. Salmon are hardwired to swim upstream - it's one of nature's most amazing instincts.

**Q: Can salmon survive jumping any height waterfall?**
Salmon can attempt impressive jumps, but extremely tall waterfalls (4+ blocks) become very challenging. They're persistent though.

**Q: Do salmon ever swim downstream?**
While their primary drive is upstream, salmon will move around locally and may drift downstream if resting or fleeing predators.
