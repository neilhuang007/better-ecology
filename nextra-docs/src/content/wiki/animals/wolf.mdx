Wolves are one of nature's most impressive hunters. Unlike most animals that hunt alone, wolves work together as a pack, coordinating their movements and strategies to take down prey. Watch a pack hunt in action and you'll see why they're such successful predators!

## Pack Life

Wolves don't just travel together - they have a real social structure. Every pack has an **alpha wolf** who leads the group and makes the important decisions, like when to hunt or where to patrol. The other wolves follow the alpha's lead, creating a well-organized hunting team.

## Hunting Together

Here's where things get really interesting. When wolves hunt, they don't just chase their prey randomly - they coordinate! You might see wolves spread out to surround their target, or work together to corner it against obstacles. It's like watching a perfectly choreographed dance, except with teeth.

Wolf packs coordinate their hunts... your sheep farm is basically an all-you-can-eat buffet to them.
</HintBox>

## Sharing is Caring

After a successful hunt, wolves share their food with pack members. It's not every animal for itself - the pack takes care of each other. This is especially true for younger or weaker wolves who might struggle to hunt on their own.

## Territory and Patrols

Wolves are territorial animals. Once a pack claims an area, they'll patrol it regularly to keep other predators out. You might spot them marking their territory or walking the same routes repeatedly. This is their home, and they're serious about defending it.

## The Howl

Listen carefully when you're near wolves - you might hear them howl! Wolves use howling to communicate with their pack, especially when members are separated. It's hauntingly beautiful and a reminder that you're in their domain.

## Taming Wolves

You can still tame wolves using bones, just like in vanilla Minecraft. But here's the twist - even after taming, your wolf companions remember their wild instincts!

<HintBox type="tip">
Tame multiple wolves and they'll form a pack with you as the alpha... they'll even coordinate when defending you.
</HintBox>

## Living with Wolves

**Best Practices:**
- Build tall fences around livestock - wolves can't jump like cats, but they're persistent
- Don't attack wolves near their pack unless you're ready for all of them to fight back
- Respect their territory if you're not equipped to handle a pack
- If you want tamed wolves but also raise sheep, keep them well separated!

## Conservation Note

Wolves are apex predators that help keep prey populations in check. Without wolves, you might see rabbit or sheep numbers explode in certain areas. They're an important part of the ecosystem, even if they occasionally make life harder for farmers!

*Wolves represent some of the most advanced AI behaviors in Better Ecology. Every pack is dynamic, with leadership that can change and hunting strategies that adapt to the terrain. No two wolf encounters are exactly the same!*
