Wolves are one of nature's most impressive hunters. Unlike most animals that hunt alone, wolves work together as a pack, coordinating their movements and strategies to take down prey. Watch a pack hunt in action and you'll see why they're such successful predators!

## Pack Life

Wolves don't just travel together - they have a real social structure. Every pack has an **alpha wolf** who leads the group and makes the important decisions, like when to hunt or where to patrol. The other wolves follow the alpha's lead, creating a well-organized hunting team.

**Try this:** Follow a wolf pack from a safe distance and watch how they move together. Notice how the alpha often leads at the front?

## Hunting Together

Here's where things get really interesting. When wolves hunt, they don't just chase their prey randomly - they coordinate! You might see wolves spread out to surround their target, or work together to corner it against obstacles. It's like watching a perfectly choreographed dance, except with teeth.

**Watch out!** If you're raising sheep, keep them well-fenced. A wolf pack that finds your farm will treat it like an all-you-can-eat buffet!

## Sharing is Caring

After a successful hunt, wolves share their food with pack members. It's not every animal for itself - the pack takes care of each other. This is especially true for younger or weaker wolves who might struggle to hunt on their own.

**Did you know?** Wolves will even bring food back to injured pack members who couldn't join the hunt!

## Territory and Patrols

Wolves are territorial animals. Once a pack claims an area, they'll patrol it regularly to keep other predators out. You might spot them marking their territory or walking the same routes repeatedly. This is their home, and they're serious about defending it.

**Tip:** If you're building near a wolf pack's territory, expect some furry neighbors. They generally leave players alone unless provoked, but they'll definitely keep an eye on you!

## The Howl

Listen carefully when you're near wolves - you might hear them howl! Wolves use howling to communicate with their pack, especially when members are separated. It's hauntingly beautiful and a reminder that you're in their domain.

**Did you know?** Wolves can hear each other's howls from over 10 kilometers away in real life! In Minecraft, you'll hear them from quite a distance too.

## Taming Wolves

You can still tame wolves using bones, just like in vanilla Minecraft. But here's the twist - even after taming, your wolf companions remember their wild instincts!

**What this means for you:**
- Tamed wolves might still want to chase sheep and other prey (keep them away from your farm animals!)
- If you tame multiple wolves, they'll form their own little pack with you as the alpha
- Your wolf pack might coordinate when defending you, just like wild wolves do when hunting
- They'll still howl to each other, creating an awesome soundtrack for your adventures

**Try this:** Tame several wolves and take them adventuring. You'll see them work together when fighting hostile mobs, using the same pack tactics they learned in the wild!

## Living with Wolves

**Best Practices:**
- Build tall fences around livestock - wolves can't jump like cats, but they're persistent
- Don't attack wolves near their pack unless you're ready for all of them to fight back
- Respect their territory if you're not equipped to handle a pack
- If you want tamed wolves but also raise sheep, keep them well separated!

**Fun Challenge:** Try to spot a wolf pack's hunting patterns. Where do they patrol? What time of day are they most active? How do they coordinate during a hunt? Understanding their behavior makes the world feel more alive!

## Conservation Note

Wolves are apex predators that help keep prey populations in check. Without wolves, you might see rabbit or sheep numbers explode in certain areas. They're an important part of the ecosystem, even if they occasionally make life harder for farmers!

*Wolves represent some of the most advanced AI behaviors in Better Ecology. Every pack is dynamic, with leadership that can change and hunting strategies that adapt to the terrain. No two wolf encounters are exactly the same!*
