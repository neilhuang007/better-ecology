## What Makes Parrots Special?

Parrots are some of the most delightful and entertaining animals you'll find in Minecraft! These vibrant birds don't just sit around looking pretty - they're full of personality, love music, and have some surprising tricks up their feathery wings.

### The Master Mimics

**Parrots can copy sounds they hear around them!** This isn't just a party trick - it's actually super useful. Your parrot might suddenly make a creeper hiss or a zombie groan, warning you about nearby dangers before you see them. Think of your parrot as a colorful, feathered alarm system!

**Did you know?** Parrots will mimic the sounds of hostile mobs, even if those mobs are hiding around corners or underground. Listen carefully to your parrot's warnings!

**Tip:** If your parrot starts making scary sounds, check your surroundings! There might be danger nearby that you haven't spotted yet.

### Dance Party Time!

**Play a music disc and watch the magic happen!** Parrots absolutely LOVE music. Put on any music disc in a jukebox and nearby parrots will start bobbing their heads and dancing. Each parrot has its own little dance moves, and watching a whole flock dance together is absolutely adorable!

**Try this:** Set up a jukebox in your base and keep a tamed parrot nearby. Whenever you play music, you'll have your own personal backup dancer! Some players even build "parrot dance floors" with multiple parrots and different jukeboxes.

### Shoulder Companions

One of the coolest things about parrots is that **they can perch on your shoulders!** Walk up to a tamed parrot and it might just hop right up. You can even have TWO parrots at once - one on each shoulder! It's like having colorful, chirping shoulder pads.

**Did you know parrots can sit on both shoulders at once?** Having a red parrot on one shoulder and a blue one on the other makes you look like a proper jungle explorer!

**How to get them off:** Jump or take damage and your parrots will flutter away. They'll follow you around on the ground until you stop moving again, then they might hop back up!

## Social Butterflies (Er... Birds!)

### Flocking Together

**Parrots are social creatures that love being around other parrots!** In the jungle, you'll often find them in groups, chirping and chattering away. They're much happier when they have parrot friends to hang out with.

**Try walking through a jungle slowly - you might spot a whole flock!** Parrots blend into the colorful jungle foliage, so move carefully and listen for their distinctive chirps. Finding a wild flock is like discovering a hidden treasure!

### Personality by Color

Different colored parrots have slightly different personalities! While all parrots share core behaviors, you might notice:

-  **Red parrots** tend to be the most energetic dancers
-  **Blue parrots** are often the loudest mimics
-  **Green parrots** love to stay hidden in jungle leaves
-  **Cyan parrots** are adventurous and curious
-  **Gray parrots** are the calmest and most observant

**Tip:** Try taming one of each color and see which personality you like best! Some players swear their blue parrot gives better warnings, while others love how chill their gray parrot is.

## Living with Parrots

### Taming Your First Parrot

Taming parrots is easy - just hold out **any kind of seeds** and right-click! They'll happily munch on:
-  Wheat seeds
-  Pumpkin seeds
-  Melon seeds
-  Beetroot seeds

**Keep trying if it doesn't work the first time!** Sometimes it takes a few seeds before the parrot warms up to you. Once you see hearts, congratulations - you've got a new friend!

### Important: NO COOKIES!

**NEVER feed parrots cookies!** This is super important - cookies are actually poisonous to parrots in Minecraft (just like chocolate is bad for real parrots). Stick to seeds and your feathered friend will be happy and healthy.

### Creating a Parrot Paradise

Want to make your parrots happy? Here's what they love:

1. **Music Corner** - Set up a jukebox with your favorite discs
2. **Perches** - Parrots love sitting on fences, especially oak and jungle wood
3. **Company** - Keep at least 2-3 parrots together so they can socialize
4. **Open Spaces** - Give them room to fly around and show off

**Did you know?** Parrots prefer perching on natural materials like wood fences rather than stone or metal. Build them some cozy wooden perches and they'll love you for it!

## Fun Activities with Parrots

### The Early Warning System

**Use parrots as mobile security guards!** Keep a parrot on your shoulder while mining or exploring. When it starts mimicking hostile mob sounds, you know danger is near - even through walls! It's like having a feathered radar system.

**Pro tip:** Experienced players keep a parrot on their shoulder during cave exploration. The parrot will mimic monster sounds before you encounter them, giving you time to prepare for battle!

### Music Appreciation

**Collect all the music discs and see which one your parrots like best!** While parrots dance to all music, some players swear their parrots bop harder to certain tracks. "Cat" and "Mellohi" are popular favorites!

**Try this:** Build a music hall with multiple jukeboxes playing different discs. Watch your parrots fly between them, picking their favorites!

### Jungle Photography

**Parrots make any screenshot better!** Their vibrant colors pop against any background. Try:
- Taking selfies with parrots on both shoulders
- Photographing a wild flock in the jungle canopy
- Capturing your parrots mid-dance
- Creating rainbow lineups with all five colors

## Finding Wild Parrots

### Where to Look

Parrots spawn in **jungle biomes** - both regular jungles and bamboo jungles. They love the dense canopy and bright flowers.

**Best searching tips:**
- Listen for their distinctive chirps and squawks
- Look up! Parrots often perch high in jungle trees
- Check around jungle temples - parrots seem to like ancient ruins
- Move slowly - sudden movements might scare them away

### Time of Day

Parrots are active during the day and sleep at night (like most birds). Your best chance of finding them is during daytime hours when they're flying around and socializing.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why won't my parrot stop making creeper sounds?**
A: There's probably a creeper nearby! Your parrot is trying to warn you. Check caves below you or dark spots around your base.

**Q: Can parrots fight for me like wolves?**
A: No, parrots are lovers, not fighters! They're purely companions. Their main combat help is warning you about danger with their mimicry.

**Q: My parrot flew away when I jumped. Is it gone forever?**
A: Nope! Tamed parrots will follow you around on the ground. Just stop moving and it should hop back on your shoulder. If it doesn't, try sitting down (sneak key) and waiting.

**Q: How do I get parrots to dance?**
A: Place a jukebox and put any music disc in it. Parrots within hearing range will automatically start dancing! No training required.

**Q: Can I breed parrots?**
A: Currently, parrots can't be bred in Minecraft. You'll need to find and tame wild parrots in the jungle if you want more feathered friends.

**Q: What's the rarest parrot color?**
A: All colors spawn with equal chance, but green parrots can be tricky to spot in the jungle because they blend in so well with the leaves!
