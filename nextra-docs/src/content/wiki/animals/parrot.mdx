Parrots are some of the most delightful and entertaining animals you'll find in Minecraft! These vibrant birds don't just sit around looking pretty - they're full of personality, love music, and have some surprising tricks up their feathery wings.

## The Master Mimics

Parrots can copy sounds they hear around them! This isn't just a party trick - it's actually super useful. Your parrot might suddenly make a creeper hiss or a zombie groan, warning you about nearby dangers before you see them.

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Parrots will mimic the sounds of hostile mobs, even if those mobs are hiding around corners or underground. Listen carefully to your parrot's warnings!
</HintBox>

<HintBox type="tip">
If your parrot starts making scary sounds, check your surroundings! There might be danger nearby that you haven't spotted yet.
</HintBox>

## Dance Party Time!

Play a music disc and watch the magic happen! Parrots absolutely LOVE music. Put on any music disc in a jukebox and nearby parrots will start bobbing their heads and dancing.

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Set up a jukebox in your base and keep a tamed parrot nearby. Whenever you play music, you'll have your own personal backup dancer! Some players even build "parrot dance floors" with multiple parrots and different jukeboxes.
</HintBox>

## Shoulder Companions

One of the coolest things about parrots is that they can perch on your shoulders! Walk up to a tamed parrot and it might just hop right up. You can even have TWO parrots at once - one on each shoulder!

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Having a red parrot on one shoulder and a blue one on the other makes you look like a proper jungle explorer! Jump or take damage and your parrots will flutter away, but they'll follow you around on the ground.
</HintBox>

## Social Butterflies

### Flocking Together

Parrots are social creatures that love being around other parrots! In the jungle, you'll often find them in groups, chirping and chattering away. They're much happier when they have parrot friends to hang out with.

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Walk through a jungle slowly - you might spot a whole flock! Parrots blend into the colorful jungle foliage, so move carefully and listen for their distinctive chirps.
</HintBox>

### Personality by Color

Different colored parrots have slightly different personalities:

- **Red parrots** tend to be the most energetic dancers
- **Blue parrots** are often the loudest mimics
- **Green parrots** love to stay hidden in jungle leaves
- **Cyan parrots** are adventurous and curious
- **Gray parrots** are the calmest and most observant

<HintBox type="tip">
Try taming one of each color and see which personality you like best! Some players swear their blue parrot gives better warnings.
</HintBox>

## Taming Your First Parrot

Taming parrots is easy - just hold out any kind of seeds and right-click! They'll happily munch on wheat seeds, pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, or beetroot seeds.

<HintBox type="mechanics">
How to tame a parrot:
1. Hold any type of seeds in your hand
2. Approach the parrot slowly
3. Right-click to feed it
4. Keep trying if hearts don't appear on the first try
5. Once you see hearts, congratulations - you've got a new friend!
</HintBox>

<HintBox type="warning">
Never feed parrots cookies. Cookies are poisonous to parrots in Minecraft (just like chocolate is bad for real parrots). Stick to seeds and your feathered friend will be happy and healthy.
</HintBox>

## Creating a Parrot Paradise

Want to make your parrots happy? Here's what they love:

1. **Music Corner** - Set up a jukebox with your favorite discs
2. **Perches** - Parrots love sitting on fences, especially oak and jungle wood
3. **Company** - Keep at least 2-3 parrots together so they can socialize
4. **Open Spaces** - Give them room to fly around and show off

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Parrots prefer perching on natural materials like wood fences rather than stone or metal. Build them some cozy wooden perches and they'll love you for it!
</HintBox>

## The Early Warning System

Use parrots as mobile security guards! Keep a parrot on your shoulder while mining or exploring. When it starts mimicking hostile mob sounds, you know danger is near - even through walls!

<HintBox type="tip">
Experienced players keep a parrot on their shoulder during cave exploration. The parrot will mimic monster sounds before you encounter them, giving you time to prepare for battle!
</HintBox>

## Finding Wild Parrots

Parrots spawn in jungle biomes - both regular jungles and bamboo jungles. They love the dense canopy and bright flowers.

**Best searching tips:**
- Listen for their distinctive chirps and squawks
- Look up! Parrots often perch high in jungle trees
- Check around jungle temples - parrots seem to like ancient ruins
- Move slowly - sudden movements might scare them away

<HintBox type="observation">
Parrots are active during the day and sleep at night. Your best chance of finding them is during daytime hours when they're flying around and socializing.
</HintBox>

## Common Questions

**Q: Why won't my parrot stop making creeper sounds?**
There's probably a creeper nearby! Your parrot is trying to warn you. Check caves below you or dark spots around your base.

**Q: Can parrots fight for me like wolves?**
No, parrots are lovers, not fighters! They're purely companions. Their main combat help is warning you about danger with their mimicry.

**Q: My parrot flew away when I jumped. Is it gone forever?**
Nope! Tamed parrots will follow you around on the ground. Just stop moving and it should hop back on your shoulder.

**Q: How do I get parrots to dance?**
Place a jukebox and put any music disc in it. Parrots within hearing range will automatically start dancing!

**Q: Can I breed parrots?**
Currently, parrots can't be bred in Minecraft. You'll need to find and tame wild parrots in the jungle if you want more feathered friends.

## Fun Facts

<HintBox type="funFact">
Parrots react to note blocks too, not just jukeboxes! They can detect hostile mobs through walls up to 20 blocks away, and some tracks last over 5 minutes - meaning 5 minutes of non-stop parrot dancing!
</HintBox>
