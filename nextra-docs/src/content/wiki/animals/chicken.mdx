## Watch Them Live Their Lives

Chickens in Better Ecology are no longer just wandering randomly. They're actually living like real chickens! Here's what you might notice when you spend time observing them.

### They Stick Together

Chickens are social birds and they know it. You'll often find them hanging out in little groups, moving together and keeping each other company. When one chicken wanders off to investigate something interesting, the others often follow along. It's really charming to watch a flock move as a group across your farm.

**Tip:** Try building a nice open coop or fenced area. Chickens will naturally gather together, especially if there's food and safe spots to rest. You'll see them creating their own little chicken community!

### Always Searching for Food

Watch a chicken for a minute and you'll see them do what chickens do best - scratch and peck at the ground. They're looking for seeds, bugs, and other tasty snacks. If they're standing on grass or dirt, you might notice them stop, look down, and start pecking. Sometimes they even find seeds while doing this!

This behavior is more frequent when chickens are hungry. If you've got grass blocks around, you'll see chickens pausing to investigate them regularly.

**Did you know?** Chickens are more active foragers when they're hungry. A well-fed chicken might peck occasionally out of habit, but a hungry chicken will be constantly on the lookout for food!

### Dust Bathing - Nature's Spa Day

Here's one of the coolest behaviors - chickens take dust baths! If you have patches of dirt or sand around, you might catch chickens rolling around in them, kicking up little puffs of dust. They're not just being silly - this is how chickens keep themselves clean and healthy in the wild.

Look for chickens to find a nice dirt spot, settle down, and create a little cloud of particles as they rub the dirt into their feathers. Sometimes multiple chickens will dust bathe together in the same spot, which is adorable.

**Where they love to bathe:**
- Regular dirt blocks
- Coarse dirt
- Sand (any color)

**Tip:** Create a dedicated dust bathing area by placing a few sand or dirt blocks in your coop. You might see several chickens using it throughout the day, sometimes together!

### Finding Safe Roosts at Night

When evening comes (around sunset in-game), chickens start looking for somewhere safe to sleep. They don't just sit on the ground - they want to get up high where predators can't reach them!

Chickens will actively search for elevated perches like:
- Fences (any wood type)
- Logs and wood blocks
- Stone walls

Once a chicken finds a good roosting spot, they'll hop up and stay there through the night. You might notice several chickens settling onto the same fence line as darkness falls. It's peaceful watching them all find their spots for the evening.

**Tip:** Build some fences around your coop or place a few logs at different heights. As night approaches, watch the chickens naturally seek out these spots. They prefer roosting 1-3 blocks off the ground.

### They Scare Easy

Chickens are pretty skittish! If you or a predator (like a fox or ocelot) gets too close, they'll scatter and run away. You might notice them fleeing in different directions when startled, then regrouping once they feel safe again.

**The freeze response:** Interestingly, if a predator gets VERY close (within a couple blocks), chickens might freeze up instead of running. This is actually realistic prey behavior!

**Tip:** Try sneaking up slowly (hold Shift) when approaching chickens. They're less scared if you move calmly rather than sprinting at them. Great for collecting eggs without causing a panic!

### Baby Chicks Are Extra Cautious

Baby chicks try to stay near their parents and other adult chickens. They're even more nervous than adults and will flee from threats more readily. If you see a chick separated from the group, it'll usually try to make its way back to other chickens.

## Living With Chickens

### Building the Perfect Coop

Here's what makes chickens happy:
- **Space to roam:** They like to wander and forage, so don't make the coop too cramped
- **Grass or dirt patches:** For foraging and dust bathing
- **Fences or logs:** For nighttime roosting
- **Hay bales:** Chickens like cozy enclosed areas for nesting

**Try this setup:** A fenced area with grass blocks, a few patches of sand or dirt for dust bathing, and wooden fences or a log structure for roosting. Add some hay bales in a sheltered corner. Your chickens will use all these features naturally throughout the day!

### What You'll See During the Day

**Morning (Dawn):** Chickens wake up and start coming down from their roosts. They'll begin foraging and moving around.

**Daytime:** Active foraging, dust bathing, and social behaviors. You'll see them pecking at the ground, gathering in groups, and occasionally taking dust baths.

**Evening (Dusk):** Around sunset, chickens start looking for roosting spots. They'll pathfind to fences or elevated blocks and settle in for the night.

**Night:** Chickens stay on their roosts until dawn, safe from ground-level threats.

### Breeding and Eggs

Chickens still lay eggs regularly (every 5-10 minutes), and you can still breed them with seeds. The difference is that now they'll naturally find nice spots to settle, and baby chicks will exhibit cautious behavior, sticking close to adults.

## Fun Observations

**Watch for these moments:**
- A group of chickens all dust bathing together in the same sand pit
- Chickens forming a line on a fence at sunset, settling in one by one
- A chicken pausing mid-walk to peck at the ground, then continuing on
- The whole flock scattering when startled, then slowly regrouping
- Chickens investigating new blocks you place, especially hay bales

**Nature documentary tip:** Grab some seeds and sit quietly near your chicken coop for a few minutes. You'll be amazed at how much natural behavior you can observe when you're not chasing them around!

## Trivia

- Chickens prefer social dust bathing - they like to bathe where other chickens have bathed
- A chicken's dust bath can last 20-30 seconds with particles flying
- Roosting chickens will slightly shift and adjust on their perch throughout the night
- When chickens flee, they might kick up dust particles as they run
- Chickens make soft clucking sounds while dust bathing
