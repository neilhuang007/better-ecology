## Behavior

Foxes are some of the most fascinating creatures you'll encounter! These clever hunters are most active during the magical twilight hours - dawn and dusk - when they emerge to hunt, explore, and cache food for later. During the day, you'll often find them curled up sleeping in cozy spots.

### The Twilight Hunter

<HintBox type="tip">
Try staying up at dawn or dusk to spot foxes on the hunt! This is when foxes are at their most active. If you're patient and quiet, you might witness some amazing hunting behaviors.
</HintBox>

As the sun rises or sets, foxes emerge from their resting spots and begin patrolling their territory, looking for prey.

### The Famous Fox Pounce

<HintBox type="info">
Did you know foxes can hear mice under the snow? One of the most spectacular sights in Better Ecology is watching a fox perform its signature hunting move - the pounce!
</HintBox>

Foxes will leap high into the air and dive down onto their prey from above. It's not just for show - this technique is incredibly effective for catching small animals like chickens and rabbits.

Watch for a fox to pause, tilt its head (listening carefully), then suddenly leap up and dive down. That's a fox using its incredible hearing to pinpoint prey!

### Food Caching

<HintBox type="success">
Watch where foxes bury their food - you might find their stash! Mark that spot, and you could come back later to discover what they've hidden.
</HintBox>

Foxes are smart about food management. When a fox catches more food than it can eat right away, it will bury the extra for later. These hidden food caches are scattered around the fox's territory.

If you follow a fox after a successful hunt, you might see it dig a small hole, drop the food, and cover it back up.

### Hunting Behavior

<HintBox type="warning">
Protect your chickens! Foxes are clever and persistent. If you're keeping chickens or rabbits as livestock, foxes pose a real threat. Build secure enclosures with good lighting and tall fences.
</HintBox>

These sneaky predators will patrol near easy prey and strike when the opportunity arises. A well-timed pounce can catch even the most alert chicken off guard.

Foxes are opportunistic but not supernatural - proper protection will keep your animals safe!

## Daily Routine

### Dawn (Sunrise)
Foxes wake up from their nighttime rest and begin their morning hunt. This is prime hunting time! Watch for:
- Stretching and yawning after waking
- Patrolling their territory
- Stalking and pouncing on prey
- Caching extra food

### Midday
**Naptime!** During the bright daylight hours, foxes curl up in shaded spots to sleep. You might find them:
- Under trees
- In forest clearings
- Near berry bushes
- Curled up in a ball with their tail wrapped around them

<HintBox type="tip">
This is the safest time to observe foxes up close, but approach slowly - they'll wake up if you get too close!
</HintBox>

### Dusk (Sunset)
The second active period begins! Foxes emerge for their evening hunt with the same behaviors as dawn. This is often when they're most successful, as their prey is also active during twilight hours.

### Night
Foxes wind down and find a safe spot to rest through the night.

## Fox Kits (Babies)

Baby foxes are **absolutely adorable** and noticeably different from adults!

<HintBox type="info">
Fox kits are playful and curious - unlike their cautious parents, young foxes love to play! You might see them pouncing on nothing (practicing hunting!), chasing each other, or following their parents around.
</HintBox>

<HintBox type="success">
Fox kits born from tamed parent foxes will be much friendlier to players. This is the key to having foxes that trust you!
</HintBox>

## Befriending Foxes

### The Trust Challenge

Foxes are **very shy around players** unless bred from tamed parents. Wild adult foxes will keep their distance and flee if you approach too quickly. However, there's a special trick to getting friendly foxes:

1. **Find two wild foxes** (usually at dawn or dusk)
2. **Feed them sweet berries** to make them trust you temporarily
3. **Breed them** - the baby will trust you!
4. **Raise the kit** - this fox won't flee from you like wild foxes do

<HintBox type="info">
Did you know? Only foxes born in your presence will truly trust you. You can't tame an adult wild fox directly!
</HintBox>

### Best Approach for Wild Foxes

1. **Crouch** to appear less threatening
2. **Move during their active hours** (dawn/dusk)
3. **Hold sweet berries** to show you're friendly
4. **Keep your distance** - foxes are more skittish than wolves
5. **Be patient** - trust takes time!

### Feeding

Foxes love:
-  **Sweet Berries** - Their favorite food for breeding and trust!

## Predator & Prey Dynamics

### What Foxes Hunt

Foxes are natural predators of:
- **Chickens** - Easy targets, foxes love them
- **Rabbits** - Harder to catch due to zigzag fleeing, but foxes are persistent

<HintBox type="tip">
Watch a hunt unfold! If you position yourself quietly near chickens or rabbits at dawn or dusk, you might see the whole hunting sequence: Fox spots prey, crouches and stalks slowly, gets in range, then POUNCE! - The spectacular leap attack!
</HintBox>

### Who Hunts Foxes?

While foxes are predators, they're also cautious around:
- **Wolves** - Natural enemies! Foxes will avoid wolves
- **Players** - Unless raised from birth, foxes keep their distance

## Survival Tips

<HintBox type="warning">
Berry farms attract foxes! If you plant sweet berry bushes, don't be surprised if foxes start showing up. They're drawn to their favorite food source.
</HintBox>

<HintBox type="tip">
Foxes can jump! Don't underestimate their agility. They can clear fences that would stop most animals.
</HintBox>

- **Listen for their sounds** - Foxes make distinctive noises. If you hear fox calls at dawn or dusk, there's one nearby!

- **Raid their caches carefully** - If you find a fox's food stash, taking it won't make the fox aggressive, but the fox might re-cache in a different spot next time.

- **Snow biome foxes are different** - White foxes in snowy areas have the same behaviors but blend in better with their environment!

## Fun Facts

- Foxes can carry items in their mouths - sometimes you'll see them trotting around with prey or treasures!
- A fox's pounce can reach impressive heights - they're like acrobatic hunters
- Foxes remember multiple cache locations across their territory
- The head-tilt before pouncing helps them pinpoint prey using sound
- Fox kits learn hunting behaviors by watching and mimicking their parents
- Foxes are more successful hunters during their crepuscular (dawn/dusk) active times

*Remember: Foxes are wild hunters with complex behaviors. Whether you want to protect your livestock from them, breed friendly foxes, or just observe these clever creatures in action, understanding their twilight schedule is the key to success!*
