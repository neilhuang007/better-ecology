Frogs are patient ambush hunters that inhabit swamps and wetlands across Minecraft's world. These colorful amphibians wait motionless for their prey before striking with lightning-fast tongue attacks.
## Behavior

### Ambush Hunting

Frogs are master ambush predators. Watch them carefully - they'll sit completely still, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. When a small slime or magma cube wanders too close, the frog lashes out with its sticky tongue in a split second!

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Try watching a frog hunt at night near a swamp. Their patience is incredible, sometimes waiting for minutes before the perfect opportunity presents itself.
</HintBox>

### Color Variants

Frogs come in three distinct colors, each adapted to different climates:

- **Temperate Frogs** (Orange) - Found in moderate biomes
- **Cold Frogs** (Green) - Adapted to chilly environments
- **Warm Frogs** (White) - Thrive in hot, humid areas

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
A frog's color isn't determined at birth - tadpoles grow into different variants based on the temperature of the biome they mature in!
</HintBox>

### Tadpole Development

Baby frogs start life as tadpoles, swimming freely in water. As they grow, the temperature of their surroundings determines which variant they'll become:

- Tadpoles in warm biomes grow into white frogs
- Tadpoles in cold biomes become green frogs
- Tadpoles in temperate biomes turn into orange frogs

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Transport tadpoles between different biome temperatures and watch them transform into different colored frogs!
</HintBox>

## Diet and Prey

Frogs are specialized hunters with a very specific menu:

- **Small Slimes** - Easy targets for a quick snack
- **Magma Cubes** - A dangerous but rewarding meal

### Froglight Production

Here's something magical - when a frog successfully eats a magma cube, it produces a **Froglight**! The color of the froglight depends on which frog variant consumed the magma cube:

- Temperate frogs create Pearlescent Froglights
- Cold frogs produce Verdant Froglights
- Warm frogs generate Ochre Froglights

<HintBox type="hint">
Set up a magma cube farm near your frog habitat to harvest all three froglight colors!
</HintBox>

## Movement and Habitat

### Jumping Ability

Frogs are incredible jumpers, capable of leaping several blocks high and far. This makes them surprisingly mobile despite spending much of their time sitting still. Watch them navigate terrain - they can clear obstacles that would stop many other animals.

### Preferred Environment

While frogs can survive in various locations, they strongly prefer swampy areas with:

- Plenty of water for swimming
- Lily pads for resting
- Humid air and moderate temperatures
- Areas where prey naturally spawns

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Frogs are amphibians, which means they're equally comfortable on land and in water. You'll often see them switching between the two throughout the day.
</HintBox>

## Communication

Frogs aren't silent hunters - they croak to communicate with each other! Listen carefully in swamp biomes, especially at dawn and dusk. The croaking serves multiple purposes:

- Establishing territory
- Attracting mates
- Warning other frogs of danger
- Social bonding within frog groups

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Gather several frogs in one area and listen to them create a chorus of croaks. It's one of the most atmospheric sounds in Minecraft!
</HintBox>

## Player Interaction

### Peaceful Nature

Frogs are completely passive creatures and will never attack players. Feel free to approach them, though sudden movements might startle them into hopping away.

### Breeding

Frogs can be bred using slimeballs. When two frogs breed, they produce tadpoles rather than baby frogs. Remember - where those tadpoles grow up determines what color frogs they become!

### Farming Tips

Want to create a frog farm for froglights? Here's what works best:

1. Build your farm in a swamp biome for authenticity
2. Create separate pools for each biome temperature if you want all three variants
3. Set up a magma cube spawner or farm nearby
4. Give frogs plenty of space to hunt naturally
5. Add lily pads and vegetation for a natural habitat

## Conservation Notes

Frogs play an important role in wetland ecosystems by controlling slime populations. Protect swamp biomes to ensure these remarkable hunters continue to thrive!
