## Behavior

Rabbits are some of the most cautious creatures in Minecraft! These fluffy hoppers are always on high alert, ready to bolt at the slightest sign of danger. If you want to observe them up close, you'll need patience and a gentle approach.

### Fear & Flight

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Try sneaking and moving slowly - rabbits notice sudden movements! Even sprinting nearby can spook them into fleeing. Crouch-walking is your best friend when approaching these nervous little friends.
</HintBox>

Watch rabbits flee - their zigzag pattern is nature's escape trick! When threatened, rabbits don't just run in a straight line. They hop left, then right, then left again in an unpredictable pattern that makes them incredibly hard to catch. It's fascinating to watch and surprisingly effective!

### Warning Signals

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Rabbits thump to warn their friends! When a rabbit spots danger, it thumps its hind legs on the ground to alert nearby rabbits. If you hear that distinctive thump-thump, it means you've been spotted!
</HintBox>

### Safe Havens

Rabbits have burrows they retreat to when scared. These cozy underground homes serve as their ultimate safe space. When a rabbit gets spooked, it will often make a beeline for its burrow entrance. If you see a rabbit disappear into the ground, that's its burrow - give it some time and space before trying to approach again.

### Active Hours

Rabbits are most active at **dawn and dusk** (crepuscular). During the middle of the day and the deep night, they're more likely to stay near their burrows or rest. Plan your rabbit-watching adventures for sunrise or sunset for the best chance to see them hopping about!

## Baby Rabbits

Baby bunnies are extra cautious compared to adults! While adult rabbits are already quite skittish, young rabbits take it to another level. They flee at even greater distances and are incredibly quick to panic. This makes sense - in the wild, young rabbits are the most vulnerable!

<HintBox type="hint">
If you want to breed rabbits, you'll need to be extra patient with the babies. Give them plenty of space and time to feel safe.
</HintBox>

## Befriending Rabbits

### Attracting Rabbits

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Plant a carrot garden and rabbits might visit! Rabbits are naturally drawn to areas with their favorite foods. If you create a peaceful garden with carrots or dandelions, you might attract wild rabbits to your homestead.
</HintBox>

### Best Approach

1. **Crouch** to reduce your perceived threat
2. **Move slowly** - no sprinting or jumping
3. **Hold a carrot** to show you're friendly
4. **Be patient** - let them come to you
5. **Watch for thumping** - if they thump, you're too close!

### Feeding

Rabbits love:
-  **Carrots** - Their absolute favorite!
-  **Dandelions** - A tasty treat

Hold out these items and stay very still. A brave rabbit might just hop close enough to nibble from your hand!

## Survival Tips

- **Hunting rabbits is tough!** Their zigzag escape pattern and high speed make them one of the hardest passive mobs to catch. Bow and arrow is your best bet if you're desperate for rabbit hide or meat.

- **Build fences carefully** - Rabbits can jump! Make sure your fences are tall enough or they'll simply hop right over.

- **Nighttime is safer** - Rabbits are less active during the night, making them slightly easier to approach (though still very cautious!).

- **Listen for thumps** - That sound means there's a rabbit nearby that's spotted a threat (maybe you, maybe a wolf!).

## Fun Facts

- Rabbits have some of the best hearing in Minecraft - they can detect threats from very far away!
- A rabbit's zigzag pattern isn't random - it's designed to confuse predators
- Rabbits remember their burrow locations and will return to them when threatened
- Groups of rabbits will all respond to a single rabbit's warning thump - teamwork!

*Remember: Patience is key with rabbits. These gentle creatures are built for survival, not trust. But with enough carrots, calm movements, and respect for their space, you might just make a fluffy friend!*
