# Ocelot

The ocelot is a mysterious jungle predator that stalks its prey through the dense undergrowth. These elusive cats are masters of stealth, moving silently through the shadows before striking with lightning speed.

## Behavior Overview

Ocelots are solitary hunters that rely on patience and precision. Unlike wolves that chase their prey across open ground, ocelots prefer the ambush - waiting motionless before launching a swift attack on unsuspecting targets.

### Hunting

Ocelots are specialized predators with a taste for small prey. You'll find them hunting:
- **Chickens** - Their primary target, hunted with calculated stalks
- **Baby Turtles** - Vulnerable hatchlings make easy prey on beaches near jungles

**Tip:** Watch for the telltale crouch when an ocelot spots prey. They'll freeze, lower their body, and creep forward before the final pounce.

### Shyness and Trust

These cautious cats are naturally wary of players. Approach too quickly and they'll bolt into the jungle foliage. Building trust with an ocelot requires patience:

- **Sneaking is key** - Crouch-walk to avoid startling them
- **Bring raw fish** - Cod or salmon will gradually earn their trust
- **Move slowly** - Sudden movements send them fleeing
- **Be patient** - Trust builds over multiple encounters

**Did you know...** Once an ocelot trusts you, it won't flee anymore and will follow you around like a loyal companion.

### Protective Presence

Tamed ocelots provide valuable protection around your base:
- **Creeper deterrent** - Creepers actively avoid ocelots and won't approach to explode
- **Phantom repellent** - These flying menaces stay clear of ocelots

**Try...** Keeping a tamed ocelot near your home entrance to create a creeper-free zone.

### Family Bonds

Ocelot mothers are fiercely protective of their cubs:
- **Cubs stay close** - Young ocelots remain near their mother for safety
- **Learning to hunt** - Cubs observe their mother's stalking techniques
- **Gradual independence** - As they grow, cubs venture further from their parent

## Quick Reference

| **Hunting** | Stealth and ambush |
| **Habitat** | Jungles |

## Survival Tips

**For New Players:**
- Don't chase ocelots - you'll never catch them. Let them come to you.
- Keep raw fish in your hotbar when exploring jungles.
- If you're building in a jungle biome, tamed ocelots make excellent guards against creepers.

**For Advanced Players:**
- Ocelots won't hunt chickens you've fenced in, but wild chickens in the jungle are fair game.
- Create a "safe zone" around your base by keeping multiple tamed ocelots nearby.
- Beach biomes adjacent to jungles are prime ocelot hunting grounds - watch for them stalking turtle hatchlings.

## Discovery Notes

The jungle comes alive differently when you know what to look for. An ocelot's presence is often revealed by:
- Chickens suddenly fleeing through underbrush
- A flash of spotted fur disappearing into leaves
- The conspicuous absence of small animals in certain areas
- Creepers turning away from specific parts of the jungle

**Try...** Sitting quietly in a jungle at dawn or dusk. Ocelots are most active during these twilight hours, and you might spot one beginning its hunt.

*The ocelot exemplifies the predator-prey dynamics of Better Ecology. Every hunt, every cautious approach, every moment of stillness before the strike - these are the behaviors that make Minecraft's jungles feel truly alive.*
