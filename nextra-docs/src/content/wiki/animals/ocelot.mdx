# Ocelot

The ocelot is a mysterious jungle predator that stalks its prey through the dense undergrowth. These elusive cats are masters of stealth, moving silently through the shadows before striking with lightning speed.

## Quick Facts

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Health** | 5 hearts |
| **Tameable** | Gain trust with raw fish |
| **Hunting** | Stealth and ambush |
| **Habitat** | Jungles |
## Survival Tips

**For New Players:**
- Don't chase ocelots - you'll never catch them. Let them come to you.
- Keep raw fish in your hotbar when exploring jungles.
- If you're building in a jungle biome, tamed ocelots make excellent guards against creepers.

**For Advanced Players:**
- Ocelots won't hunt chickens you've fenced in, but wild chickens in the jungle are fair game.
- Create a "safe zone" around your base by keeping multiple tamed ocelots nearby.
- Beach biomes adjacent to jungles are prime ocelot hunting grounds - watch for them stalking turtle hatchlings.

## Discovery Notes

The jungle comes alive differently when you know what to look for. An ocelot's presence is often revealed by:
- Chickens suddenly fleeing through underbrush
- A flash of spotted fur disappearing into leaves
- The conspicuous absence of small animals in certain areas
- Creepers turning away from specific parts of the jungle

**Try...** Sitting quietly in a jungle at dawn or dusk. Ocelots are most active during these twilight hours, and you might spot one beginning its hunt.

*The ocelot exemplifies the predator-prey dynamics of Better Ecology. Every hunt, every cautious approach, every moment of stillness before the strike - these are the behaviors that make Minecraft's jungles feel truly alive.*
