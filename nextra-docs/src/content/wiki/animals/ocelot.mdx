The ocelot is a mysterious jungle predator that stalks its prey through the dense undergrowth. These elusive cats are masters of stealth, moving silently through the shadows before striking with lightning speed.

## The Silent Hunter

Ocelots are the ghosts of the jungle. They move through the foliage with barely a sound, their spotted coats blending perfectly with the dappled light filtering through the canopy. Unlike their domesticated cat cousins, ocelots remain wild and untameable - though they can learn to trust you.

<HintBox type="observation">
Watch an ocelot stalk prey through the jungle. Notice how it uses vegetation for cover, freezing completely still when the target looks its way.
</HintBox>

## Hunting Behavior

When an ocelot spots potential prey, it enters a focused hunting mode:
- Crouches low to the ground
- Moves in slow, calculated steps
- Uses jungle vegetation as cover
- Freezes when prey shows alertness
- Strikes with explosive speed when within range

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Ocelots primarily hunt chickens in Minecraft. In the wild, they'll patrol the jungle floor looking for any chickens that have wandered too far from safety.
</HintBox>

## Gaining Trust

Unlike cats, ocelots cannot be fully tamed. However, you can gain their trust by feeding them raw fish. A trusting ocelot will:
- No longer flee from you
- Breed with other trusting ocelots
- Remain wild but tolerant of your presence

<HintBox type="tip">
To gain an ocelot's trust, hold raw fish and stand very still. Let the ocelot approach you. Any sudden movement will cause it to flee!
</HintBox>

<HintBox type="mechanics">
Gaining trust requires patience:
1. Hold raw cod or raw salmon
2. Stand completely still - don't even turn your camera
3. Wait for the ocelot to slowly approach
4. When it's close enough, feed it
5. Repeat until hearts appear
</HintBox>

## Creeper Repellent

Like their domesticated relatives, ocelots scare creepers. This makes jungle areas naturally safer from creeper explosions:

- Creepers will flee from ocelots
- Wild ocelots provide passive protection in jungles
- Having ocelots near your jungle base adds a layer of safety

<HintBox type="tip">
Building a base in a jungle? Don't chase away the local ocelots. They're providing free creeper protection for the entire area!
</HintBox>

## Finding Ocelots

Ocelots spawn exclusively in jungle biomes. They're rare and shy, making them challenging to spot:

**Where to look:**
- Deep jungle areas with lots of vegetation
- Near jungle edges where they hunt
- Look for chickens fleeing - an ocelot might be nearby

**When to look:**
- Dawn and dusk are peak activity times
- They're harder to spot in bright daylight
- Listen for chicken distress sounds

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Sit quietly in a jungle at dawn or dusk. Ocelots are most active during these twilight hours, and you might spot one beginning its hunt.
</HintBox>

## Ocelots vs Cats

While ocelots and cats share similar hunting behaviors, there are key differences:

| Aspect | Ocelot | Cat |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Taming | Gains trust only | Fully tameable |
| Spawn | Jungles only | Villages |
| Following | Won't follow you | Will follow when tamed |
| Gifts | None | Brings gifts when sleeping |
| Appearance | Spotted wild pattern | Multiple coat patterns |

<HintBox type="info">
Historically, ocelots could be tamed into cats. This was changed in later Minecraft versions - now they're separate species with different behaviors.
</HintBox>

## Breeding Ocelots

If you've gained the trust of two ocelots, you can breed them:
1. Feed each trusting ocelot raw fish
2. Hearts will appear
3. A baby ocelot (kitten) will spawn
4. The kitten will automatically trust you

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Baby ocelots are even more skittish than adults. They'll flee at the slightest disturbance until they grow up!
</HintBox>

## Survival Tips

**For New Players:**
- Don't chase ocelots - you'll never catch them. Let them come to you.
- Keep raw fish in your hotbar when exploring jungles.
- If you're building in a jungle biome, ocelots provide passive creeper protection.

**For Advanced Players:**
- Ocelots won't hunt chickens you've fenced in, but wild chickens in the jungle are fair game.
- Create a "safe zone" around your base by keeping multiple trusting ocelots nearby.
- Beach biomes adjacent to jungles are prime ocelot hunting grounds - watch for them stalking turtle hatchlings.

## Discovery Notes

The jungle comes alive differently when you know what to look for. An ocelot's presence is often revealed by:
- Chickens suddenly fleeing through underbrush
- A flash of spotted fur disappearing into leaves
- The conspicuous absence of small animals in certain areas
- Creepers turning away from specific parts of the jungle

<HintBox type="observation">
The absence of prey can indicate a predator's presence. If you find an area of jungle suspiciously devoid of chickens, an ocelot has likely been hunting there.
</HintBox>
