# Welcome to Better Ecology

Ever wondered why Minecraft animals feel a bit... robotic? Better Ecology changes that. Animals now behave like real creatures - they form groups, flee from danger, and interact with their world in ways that feel natural and alive.

## What Makes Animals Special?

Animals in Better Ecology don't just wander aimlessly anymore. They make decisions based on what's happening around them. Watch a flock of chickens and you might see them move together as a group. Observe cows grazing and you'll notice them actually paying attention to each other and their surroundings.

## The Animals

### Chickens
These feathered friends are more skittish than ever. They'll flee from foxes and other predators, and you might catch them taking dust baths on warm afternoons. Try watching a flock - they stick together and follow each other's lead.

**Tip:** Chickens are most active during dawn and dusk. That's when you'll see their liveliest behaviors!

### Cows
Cows are social creatures who like to stay near their herd. They'll graze peacefully during the day, but don't let a predator get too close - they know when to run.

**Did you know?** Cows will look around at their neighbors before deciding to move. One cow's decision can influence the whole herd!

### Sheep
Sheep are natural followers. Watch closely and you'll see how one brave sheep can lead the entire flock to greener pastures. They're cautious animals who prefer safety in numbers.

**Try this:** Stand still near a flock of sheep and watch how they move together. It's like they're having a silent conversation!

### Pigs
Pigs are curious foragers who explore their surroundings looking for the best spots to root around. They're less skittish than chickens but still know when danger is near.

### Rabbits
These small speedsters are always on high alert. They'll bolt at the first sign of danger, zigzagging to confuse predators. Their flight response is incredibly fast - blink and you might miss it!

**Tip:** Rabbits panic more easily than other animals. Approach them slowly and carefully if you want to observe their natural behaviors.

### Foxes
Foxes are cunning predators who hunt chickens and rabbits. They'll stalk their prey carefully, using cover when they can. You might see them coordinating with other foxes when hunting in the same area.

### Wolves
Wolves are pack hunters who work together to bring down prey. They're territorial and will defend their space from threats. A lone wolf behaves differently than a wolf in a pack.

**Did you know?** Tamed wolves still retain some of their wild instincts, even while protecting you!

## Tips for Watching Animals

- **Be patient:** Animal behaviors unfold naturally. Sometimes you need to watch for a few minutes to see something interesting.
- **Stay quiet:** Animals are more likely to behave naturally if you're not chasing them around.
- **Look for patterns:** Does one animal seem to lead the group? Are they more active at certain times?
- **Pay attention to groups:** The magic really happens when animals interact with each other.

## Making It Your Own

Better Ecology lets you adjust how animals behave through configuration files. Want chickens to be braver? Want sheep to follow their leaders more closely? You can tweak those settings to match your playstyle.

The configuration files are found in your world's `config/better-ecology/` folder. Each animal has its own settings you can experiment with.

**Note:** If you're just starting out, the default settings provide a balanced, realistic experience. Feel free to explore the configs when you're ready to dive deeper!

Happy exploring, and enjoy watching your Minecraft world come alive!
