# Welcome to Better Ecology

Ever wondered why Minecraft animals feel a bit... robotic? Well, not anymore! Better Ecology brings animals to life with behaviors that feel natural and real. Watch them form groups, make decisions together, and interact with their world in ways that'll make you stop and stare.

## What Makes This Special?

Animals aren't just wandering around randomly now. They're actually living! Chickens flock together and dust bathe. Cows graze in herds and protect their calves. Wolves hunt in packs. Each creature has its own personality and purpose.

<HintBox type="tip">
The best way to discover Better Ecology is to just watch. Find a group of animals, sit quietly nearby, and see what happens. You'll be surprised!
</HintBox>

## Meet the Animals

### Farm Animals

The peaceful creatures you'll see around your homestead.

**[Cow](/docs/wiki/animals/cow)** - Social grazers who move in herds and protect their young. Watch how one cow's decision ripples through the whole group.

**[Sheep](/docs/wiki/animals/sheep)** - Natural followers who stick together for safety. One brave sheep can lead the whole flock to greener pastures.

**[Pig](/docs/wiki/animals/pig)** - Curious foragers always sniffing around for the next tasty spot. They're smarter than they look!

**[Chicken](/docs/wiki/animals/chicken)** - Skittish flockers who roost at night and dust bathe during the day. Dawn and dusk are when they really come alive.

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
Farm animals are most interesting in groups! Keep at least 4-5 together and you'll see social behaviors emerge that single animals never show.
</HintBox>

### Predators

The hunters who keep the ecosystem in balance.

**[Wolf](/docs/wiki/animals/wolf)** - Pack hunters with territorial instincts. A lone wolf behaves very differently than a pack. Even tamed wolves remember their wild roots!

**[Fox](/docs/wiki/animals/fox)** - Cunning stalkers who hunt chickens and rabbits. Watch them use cover and coordinate with other foxes in the area.

### Small Creatures

The little ones who need to stay alert to survive.

**[Rabbit](/docs/wiki/animals/rabbit)** - Lightning-fast escape artists who zigzag away from danger. They're always on high alert and panic easily.

**[Bat](/docs/wiki/animals/bat)** - Mysterious cave dwellers with their own rhythms and patterns.

**[Bee](/docs/wiki/animals/bee)** - Busy pollinators with complex colony behaviors and navigation.

Want to see realistic prey behavior? Approach a rabbit slowly versus sprinting at it. The difference in their reactions is fascinating!
</HintBox>

### Aquatic

Life beneath the waves.

**[Salmon](/docs/wiki/animals/salmon)** - Schooling fish with synchronized swimming patterns.

**[Squid](/docs/wiki/animals/squid)** - Graceful swimmers who move through water with purpose.

**[Turtle](/docs/wiki/animals/turtle)** - Patient travelers who return home to breed.

**[Frog](/docs/wiki/animals/frog)** - Amphibious jumpers navigating between water and land.

### Special Animals

Unique creatures with distinct personalities.

**[Cat](/docs/wiki/animals/cat)** - Independent hunters with selective social behaviors.

**[Ocelot](/docs/wiki/animals/ocelot)** - Stealthy jungle predators who trust slowly.

**[Parrot](/docs/wiki/animals/parrot)** - Colorful companions who mimic and observe.

**[Llama](/docs/wiki/animals/llama)** - Proud pack animals with herd dynamics.

**[Goat](/docs/wiki/animals/goat)** - Agile climbers who test boundaries and ram threats.

**[Armadillo](/docs/wiki/animals/armadillo)** - Defensive creatures who curl up when scared.

## Watching Animals in the Wild

<HintBox type="hint">
Here's the secret to seeing amazing behaviors: be patient and stay quiet. Animals act most naturally when you're not chasing them around!
</HintBox>

**What to look for:**
- Does one animal seem to lead the group?
- Do they return to favorite spots?
- How do they react when startled?
- What happens at dawn and dusk?

**Best viewing times:**
- Early morning for chickens and most farm animals
- Dusk for crepuscular behaviors (twilight activity)
- Night for predator hunting patterns
- Any time for aquatic life

<HintBox type="funFact">
The magic really happens when animals interact with each other. A single cow is interesting, but a herd of 8-10 cows shows behaviors you'd never see alone!
</HintBox>

## Understanding How It Works

Want to know what's happening under the hood?

**For Curious Players:**
- [Research Documentation](/docs/research/overview) - Learn about the real-world science behind each behavior
- [Flocking Behavior](/docs/research/flocking) - How chickens and birds move together
- [Herd Movement](/docs/research/herd-movement) - What makes cows and sheep follow each other
- [Foraging Patterns](/docs/research/foraging) - How animals find and choose food sources

**For Modders and Developers:**
- [Architecture Overview](/docs/systems/architecture) - How Better Ecology is built
- [Behavior System](/docs/systems/behavior-system) - Creating custom animal behaviors
- [API Documentation](/docs/api) - Integrate Better Ecology with your own mods

<HintBox type="didYouKnow">
All animal behaviors are based on real scientific research! Check out the research docs to see the papers and studies that inspired each system.
</HintBox>

## Making It Your Own

Better Ecology is designed to be flexible. Want chickens to be braver? Want wolves to hunt more aggressively? You can adjust everything!

Configuration files live in your world's `config/better-ecology/` folder. Each animal has its own settings you can tweak.

<HintBox type="tip">
Start with the default settings - they're balanced for realistic behavior. Once you've watched animals for a while, you'll know exactly what to adjust!
</HintBox>

## Start Exploring

Click on any animal above to learn their secrets. You'll discover:
- What makes each species unique
- Tips for observing them in the wild
- How to create perfect habitats
- Hidden behaviors you might have missed
- Fun experiments to try

<HintBox type="tryThis">
Pick one animal and really study it for a Minecraft day. You'll notice patterns and behaviors you'd miss just walking by. It's like being a nature documentary filmmaker!
