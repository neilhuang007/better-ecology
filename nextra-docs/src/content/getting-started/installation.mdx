   - Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`
   - Linux: `~/.minecraft`

### 5. Launch Minecraft

## Verifying Installation

Once in-game, you can verify the mod is working by:

1. Spawning sheep and observing grazing behavior
2. Watching pigs root in the ground
3. Observing flock cohesion in groups of animals

## Troubleshooting

### Mod Not Loading

- Ensure you are using Minecraft 1.21.1
- Verify Fabric Loader is installed correctly
- Check that both Fabric API and Better Ecology are in the mods folder

### Game Crashes on Startup

- Check for incompatible mods
- Verify Java 21 is installed
- Review the crash log for specific errors

### Behaviors Not Working

- Run `/reload` to refresh configurations
- Check server logs for profile loading messages
- Verify configuration files are valid JSON/YAML

## Server Installation

For server installations:

1. Install Fabric on your server
2. Place mods in the server's `mods` folder
3. Configuration files are in `config/better-ecology/`

All clients connecting to the server should also have the mod installed for proper visual feedback.
