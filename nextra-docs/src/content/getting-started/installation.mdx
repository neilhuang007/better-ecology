## Requirements

Before installing Better Ecology, ensure your system meets these requirements:

| Component | Version | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Minecraft | 1.21.1 | Exact version required |
| Java | 21+ | Java 21 or newer |
| Fabric Loader | 0.15+ | Latest recommended |
| Fabric API | Latest | Download from Modrinth |

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install Better Ecology on your Minecraft client or server.

### Step 1: Install Fabric Loader

The Fabric Loader enables mods to run on Minecraft.

1. Visit [fabricmc.net/use/](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and download the Fabric installer
2. Run the installer executable
3. Select **Minecraft 1.21.1** from the version dropdown
4. Choose your installation directory (usually auto-detected)
5. Click **Install** and wait for completion
6. Close the installer when it shows "Successfully installed"

**Verify installation**: Launch Minecraft and check that a "Fabric" profile appears in the launcher.

### Step 2: Download Required Mods

You need to download two JAR files:

**Fabric API** (Required dependency):
1. Visit [modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
2. Click the **Versions** tab
3. Download the latest version for **Minecraft 1.21.1**
4. Save the file (named like `fabric-api-0.100.0+1.21.1.jar`)

**Better Ecology**:
1. Visit the [Better Ecology releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/better-ecology/releases)
2. Download the latest `.jar` file for version 1.21.1
3. Save the file (named like `better-ecology-1.0.0+1.21.1.jar`)

### Step 3: Install the Mods

**Locate your Minecraft folder**:

```bash
# Windows
%APPDATA%\.minecraft

# macOS
~/Library/Application Support/minecraft

# Linux
~/.minecraft
```

**Install the JAR files**:

1. Navigate to your Minecraft folder
2. Open the `mods` folder
   - If the folder does not exist, create it manually
3. Copy both JAR files into the `mods` folder:
   - `fabric-api-*.jar`
   - `better-ecology-*.jar`

Your `mods` folder should now contain at least these two files.

### Step 4: Launch the Game

1. Open the **Minecraft Launcher**
2. Select the **Fabric** profile from the dropdown
3. Click **Play**
4. Wait for Minecraft to load

The mod will initialize during the loading screen. Check the game logs for confirmation.

## Verifying Installation

Once in-game, you can verify the mod is working by observing enhanced animal behaviors.

### Visual Verification

Open a creative world and spawn some animals to test:

```mcfunction
# Spawn test animals
/summon minecraft:sheep ~ ~ ~
/summon minecraft:pig ~ ~2 ~
/summon minecraft:cow ~ ~4 ~
```

**What to look for**:

1. **Sheep** will search for grass blocks and lower their heads to graze
2. **Pigs** will periodically root in the ground, creating particle effects
3. **Chickens** will peck at the ground and search for seeds
4. **Groups of animals** will maintain cohesion and avoid crowding each other

### Command Verification

Use the debug command to inspect animal data:

```mcfunction
# Check hunger and thirst values
/debugeco hunger @e[type=sheep,limit=1,sort=nearest]
/debugeco thirst @e[type=cow,limit=1,sort=nearest]
```

If the command works and returns values, the mod is properly installed.

### Log Verification

Check the game logs for the initialization message:

```
[Better Ecology] Better Ecology initialized
[Better Ecology] Registered hunger attachment
[Better Ecology] Registered thirst attachment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mod Not Loading

**Symptoms**: No behavior changes, mod does not appear in mod menu

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you are using exactly **Minecraft 1.21.1** (not 1.21 or 1.21.2)
2. Check that Fabric Loader appears in the launcher profile dropdown
3. Confirm both JAR files are in the `mods` folder (use F3 to check paths)
4. Ensure you downloaded the correct Fabric API version for 1.21.1

**Check the mods folder**:
```bash
# The mods folder should contain:
mods/
  fabric-api-0.100.0+1.21.1.jar
  better-ecology-1.0.0+1.21.1.jar
```

### Game Crashes on Startup

**Symptoms**: Minecraft crashes before reaching the main menu

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have **Java 21 or newer** installed:
   ```bash
   java -version
   # Should show version 21 or higher
   ```
2. Check for incompatible mods (remove other mods temporarily to test)
3. Review the crash log in `logs/latest.log` for specific errors
4. Look for error messages mentioning "better-ecology" or "attachment"

**Common crash causes**:
- Java version too old (Java 17 or earlier will not work)
- Conflicting mods that modify animal AI
- Corrupted JAR file (try re-downloading)

### Behaviors Not Working

**Symptoms**: Mod loads but animals behave normally

**Solutions**:
1. Run `/reload` to refresh data pack configurations
2. Check that entities were spawned **after** mod installation
   - Pre-existing entities may not have mod data attached
   - Spawn new entities with `/summon` or spawn eggs
3. Verify the animal is supported (see [Animal Overview](/animals/overview))
4. Check server logs for warnings about missing configuration files

### Incompatible Mods

The following mod types may conflict with Better Ecology:

- **AI overhaul mods** that modify mob goals (may cause conflicts)
- **Entity attribute mods** that change movement speed or health
- **Data pack mods** that replace vanilla animal behaviors

If you experience issues, try disabling these mods temporarily to isolate the problem.

## Server Installation

Better Ecology works on both single-player and multiplayer servers.

### Server Setup (Step-by-Step)

1. **Install Fabric on the server**:
   - Download the Fabric Server Launcher from [fabricmc.net](https://fabricmc.net/use/)
   - Run the installer and select your server directory
   - Select Minecraft 1.21.1 and click Install

2. **Add the mods**:
   ```bash
   # Place in the server's mods folder:
   server/
     mods/
       fabric-api-*.jar
       better-ecology-*.jar
   ```

3. **Configure the server**:
   - Configuration files will be auto-generated in `config/better-ecology/`
   - See [Configuration Guide](/getting-started/configuration) for customization

4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   # Use the Fabric server launcher
   java -jar fabric-server-launch.jar
   ```

### Client Requirements

**Important**: All players connecting to the server **must** install Better Ecology on their client for the full experience.

- Without the client mod, behaviors will still work server-side
- Players will miss visual feedback like grazing animations and particles
- Hunger/thirst HUD overlay requires the client mod

### Hot-Reloading on Servers

Server administrators can modify configurations without restarting:

```mcfunction
# After editing config files, run:
/reload
```

This reloads all data packs and applies new behavior parameters immediately.

## Next Steps

Now that Better Ecology is installed, you can:

1. **Learn about configuration**: Read the [Configuration Guide](/getting-started/configuration)
2. **Explore animal behaviors**: Check the [Animal Overview](/animals/overview)
3. **Understand the science**: See [Research Documentation](/research/overview)
4. **Customize behaviors**: Learn about the [Behavior System](/systems/behavior-system)
