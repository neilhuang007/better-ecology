# Better Ecology

Ever wondered why Minecraft chickens just wander aimlessly instead of roosting at night? Or why wolves hunt alone instead of coordinating as packs? Well, we did too. So we built a mod that gives animals the behaviors they deserve.

Better Ecology brings scientifically-grounded AI to Minecraft's animals. Cows form genuine herds with emergent leadership. Wolves coordinate ambush tactics during pack hunts. Chickens establish roosting hierarchies at nightfall. Every behavior is based on real research, not random wandering.

## What Makes This Different?

Traditional Minecraft AI uses simple random walks and basic state machines. Better Ecology implements research-backed algorithms:

- **Flocking**: Boids algorithm for cohesive group movement (Reynolds, 1987)
- **Pack Hunting**: Coordinated predation with role assignment
- **Herding**: Quorum-based collective decision making
- **Territoriality**: Breeding territory establishment and defense
- **Crepuscular Activity**: Time-based behavioral shifts (dawn/dusk behaviors)

Animals make decisions based on their environment, social context, and biological drives. The result is a living, breathing ecosystem that feels natural and engaging.
