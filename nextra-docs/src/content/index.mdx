## What is Better Ecology?

Better Ecology reimagines Minecraft's animal AI with behaviors based on real-world research. Animals don't just wander randomly anymore - they form social groups, make collective decisions, hunt cooperatively, and respond to their environment in realistic ways.

Watch sheep follow natural leaders in their flock. See wolves coordinate ambush tactics during pack hunts. Observe chickens seeking elevated roosts at nightfall. Every behavior is grounded in scientific research documented in the mod's behavior library.
