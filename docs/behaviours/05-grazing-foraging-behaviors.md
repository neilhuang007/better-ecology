# Grazing and Feeding Behaviors in Herbivores

## Overview

This document summarizes research on grazing patterns, optimal foraging theory (Marginal Value Theorem), patch selection, feeding time budgets, and resource depletion responses in herbivorous mammals.

## Key Findings

### Grazing Patterns and Movement

### Daily Grazing Patterns

- **Cattle and sheep** exhibit distinct **bimodal grazing patterns** with peaks in morning and afternoon, plus a pronounced midday rest period
- **Horses** graze more steadily throughout the day (50-80% of their time) without pronounced rest periods
- **Consistent individual differences** in cattle behavior suggest "grazing personalities" that persist over time

**Daily distance traveled varies significantly**:
- Sheep: 2.85 km/day
- Cattle: 1.68 km/day
- Horses: 1.65 km/day

### Factors Influencing Grazing Distribution

- **Abiotic factors**: slope, distance to water, terrain characteristics
- **Biotic factors**: forage availability and quality
- **Resource heterogeneity** in the environment
- **Movement speed is lower** in spring/winter with higher daily foraging percentages due to lower food resources and shorter daylight hours

## Patch Selection and Optimal Foraging Theory

### The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT)

**Core Principle**: Developed by Eric Charnov (1976), the MVT predicts when an animal should leave a resource patch to maximize overall energy intake rate.

**Mathematical Rule**: Foragers should abandon all patches once their **instantaneous intake rate falls to the same marginal capture rate** as the expected average rate across all patches in the environment.

**Critical Variables**:
- **Ti**: Time spent in a given patch (residence time)
- **Interpatch travel time**: Time moving between patches
- **Patch yield**: Amount of resources obtained
- **Intake rate**: Rate of resource acquisition within patch

**Key Predictions**:
- **Longer travel times between patches** = longer optimal giving-up times (GUTs)
- Leave patch when: **instantaneous intake rate = long-term average habitat intake rate**
- **Giving-Up Density (GUD)**: Quantifies forager's quitting harvest rate within a resource patch

### Patch Size and Scale Effects

- **Scale matters**: WallisDeVries et al. (1999) demonstrated that patch size significantly affects herbivore selectivity (240+ citations)
- **Sheep** spend more time grazing smaller grass patches (1-6 m²)
- **Red deer** show no consistent grass patch size preferences
- As **patch size and density decline**, animals walk faster, crop larger bites, and take more bites per stem

## Feeding Time Budgets

### Diurnal Patterns (24-hour cycles)

- **90% of grazing time** occurs during daytime
- **73% of ruminating time** shows strong diurnal patterns
- **Hour of day, season, and supplementary feed** significantly affect grazing, rumination, and idling behaviors
- **Sheep** spend approximately **8.57 hours grazing** on average during daylight
- **Grazing and rumination time budgets** remain similar across different forage types (pasture, chicory, silage)

### Key Relationships

- **Longer grazing time** → higher intake → **longer rumination time** required for processing
- **Idling time varies** based on forage type
- **Resting is integral** to animal fitness through optimization strategies
- Restricting pasture access results in **much greater grazing efficiency**

### Time Allocation Strategies

- **Bimodal species** (cattle, sheep): morning peak, midday rest, afternoon peak, nighttime rest
- **Continuous grazers** (horses): steady grazing throughout extended periods
- **Seasonal variation**: spring/winter show higher foraging percentages due to resource scarcity

---

## Resource Depletion and Response

### Giving-Up Density (GUD) Framework

- **GUD experimentally quantifies** forager's quitting harvest rate within a resource patch
- Animals should quit patches when **benefit (harvest rate) no longer outweighs costs** (including predation risk)
- **Social rank influences** giving-up density in group-feeding scenarios (e.g., bison studies)

### Response to Depletion

- **Herbivores become more selective** during dry seasons to obtain high-quality forage
- **Increased selectivity** driven by metabolic requirements
- **Plant quality and biomass variability** significantly influence diet selection

---

## Seasonal Changes in Grazing Behavior

### Movement and Activity Patterns

- **Movement speed**: Lower in spring and winter, higher in summer
- **Daily foraging percentage**: Higher in spring/winter due to lower food resources and shorter daylight
- **Grazing season effects**: Highly significant effects on diurnal intake time, bite weight, dry matter intake, total steps, and chews per feed

### Diet Selection Changes

- **Mega and meso-herbivores**: 25 forage plants constitute over 70% of diet year-round
- **Consistent preferences**: Despite seasonal differences, herbivores maintain preferences for adult leaves with more epiphytes and higher nitrogen content
- **Pasture selection**: Cows, mares, and ewes spend most grazing time on improved ryegrass-clover pasture regardless of season

---

## Social Feeding Behavior

### Social vs. Feeding Motivations

- **Social grouping tendencies** influence grazing behavior significantly
- **Sheep** more easily split into subgroups with familiar peers
- **Two key factors** for group-living herbivores:
  1. Feed availability
  2. Individual dominance status

### Dominance and Foraging

- **Dominance hierarchies** impact foraging behavior
- **Time of grain supplementation** and social dominance interact to affect feeding patterns
- **Grazing personalities** (consistent individual differences) affect group distribution

## Species-Specific Comparisons

### Grazing Hierarchy (University of Idaho)

**Competitive dominance**: cattle > sheep > elk > mule deer > bighorn sheep > pronghorns > white-tailed deer

### Species Comparison Table

| **Aspect** | **Cattle** | **Sheep** | **Horses** | **Deer** |
|------------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Grazing Time** | Moderate (bimodal) | Moderate (bimodal) | High (50-80%, continuous) | Variable |
| **Daily Distance** | 1.68 km | 2.85 km | 1.65 km | Not specified |
| **Soil Impact** | High compaction | Lower impact | High compaction | Low impact |
| **Forage Selection** | Grasses preferentially | More selective | Grasses preferentially | Highly selective |
| **Patch Preferences** | Medium-large patches | Small patches (1-6 m²) | Medium-large patches | No consistent preference |
| **Digestive Strategy** | Ruminant | Ruminant | Hindgut fermenter | Ruminant |

### Cattle

- **Bimodal grazing pattern** with distinct rest periods
- **Prefer grasses** over other forage types
- **Higher soil compaction** due to weight
- **Moderate daily travel distance** (1.68 km)
- **Social dominance** affects foraging in groups

### Sheep

- **More selective grazers** than cattle
- **Prefer smaller patches** (1-6 m²)
- **Longest daily travel distance** (2.85 km)
- **Lower soil impact** due to lighter weight
- **Form subgroups** based on familiarity
- **Less pasture damage** compared to cattle and horses

### Horses

- **Longest grazing time** (50-80% of day)
- **Continuous grazing pattern** without pronounced rest periods
- **Hindgut fermenters** (different digestive strategy than ruminants)
- **High soil compaction**
- **Prefer grasses**
- **Shorter daily distance** (1.65 km) despite longer grazing time

### Deer (Wild Ungulates)

- **Highly selective** foragers
- **No consistent grass patch size preferences** (1 m² to larger areas)
- **More flexible habitat use** compared to domestic species
- **Lower in grazing hierarchy** when competing with livestock
- **Migration patterns** influence diet selection
- **25 key forage plants** constitute >70% of diet

### Rabbits

- Generally known to be highly selective grazers
- Create distinct grazing lawns through intensive localized grazing

## Mathematical Models

### Functional Response Models (Holling-based)

- **Type II functional response**: Intake rate increases with resource density but plateaus due to handling time
- **Type IV functional response**: Intake rate declines at very high resource densities (recently documented in plant-herbivore systems by Mezzalira et al., 2017)
- **Intake rate formula**: Function of bite size, bite rate, and forage density

### Key Equations

**Marginal Value Theorem**:
```
Depart when: dTi/dt = average habitat intake rate
```
Where dTi/dt = instantaneous intake rate in patch

**Functional Response** (simplified):
```
Intake rate = f(bite size, bite rate, forage density, handling time)
```

**Giving-Up Density**:
```
GUD = initial resources - resources consumed when forager quits
```

## Implementation Notes for Minecraft Mod

### Key Behaviors to Implement

1. **Bimodal grazing**: Animals graze in morning and afternoon, rest midday
2. **Patch selection**: Animals move between grass patches based on Marginal Value Theorem
3. **Giving-Up Density**: Animals leave depleted patches for fresh ones
4. **Grazing personalities**: Individual variation in grazing behavior
5. **Social feeding**: Dominant animals get access to best patches
6. **Seasonal variation**: Different grazing patterns by season

### Minecraft Entity Considerations

**Vanilla animals that could benefit**:
- **Cows, Sheep, Mooshroom**: Bimodal grazing, patch selection
- **Rabbits**: Selective grazing, creating grazing lawns
- **Horses (if added)**: Continuous grazing pattern
- **Goats**: Similar to sheep, more selective

**Behavior improvements**:
- Animals actually consume grass blocks over time (regenerate later)
- Animals move between grazing areas, not just wander randomly
- Dominant animals push subordinate animals from good grazing
- Pregnant/nursing mothers have higher nutritional needs
- Seasonal changes in grazing behavior (more grazing in "winter/spring" biomes)

### Code Structure Suggestion

```java
public class GrazingBehavior {
    private final double givingUpDensity;
    private final int patchSize;

    public void tick(AnimalEntity animal) {
        // Check if it's grazing time
        long dayTime = animal.level().getDayTime() % 24000;
        if (!isGrazingTime(dayTime)) {
            return; // Resting or not grazing time
        }

        // Check current patch quality
        BlockPos currentPos = animal.blockPosition();
        double patchQuality = assessPatchQuality(currentPos);

        if (patchQuality < givingUpDensity) {
            // Leave patch, find new one
            findNewPatch(animal);
        } else {
            // Continue grazing
            graze(animal);
        }
    }

    private boolean isGrazingTime(long dayTime) {
        // Bimodal: morning (0-6000) and afternoon (8000-12000)
        return (dayTime > 1000 && dayTime < 5000) ||
               (dayTime > 8000 && dayTime < 11000);
    }

    private double assessPatchQuality(BlockPos pos) {
        int grassBlocks = 0;
        int totalBlocks = 0;

        for (BlockPos check : BlockPos.betweenClosed(
            pos.offset(-patchSize, -1, -patchSize),
            pos.offset(patchSize, -1, patchSize))) {
            totalBlocks++;
            if (animal.level().getBlockState(check).is(Blocks.GRASS)) {
                grassBlocks++;
            }
        }
        return (double) grassBlocks / totalBlocks;
    }
}
```
