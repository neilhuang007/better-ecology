# Sleeping and Resting Behaviors in Mammals and Birds

## Overview

This document summarizes research on sleep patterns, sleep site selection, vigilance during rest, social sleeping, sleep postures, and unihemispheric sleep across species.

## Key Findings

### Sleep Patterns and Activity Cycles

**Three Main Temporal Patterns**:
- **Diurnal** (~20% of mammals, most birds): Active during day, sleep at night (e.g., humans, cows, ostriches)
- **Nocturnal** (~70% of mammals): Active at night, sleep during day (e.g., most rodents, wild felids)
- **Crepuscular** (~10% of mammals): Active primarily during twilight hours (dawn and dusk)
- **Cathemeral**: Active sporadically day or night

**Key Distribution**:
- Mammals are predominantly nocturnal (70%)
- Birds are predominantly diurnal
- These patterns influence sleep timing and anti-predator strategies

## Sleep Site Selection

### Predator Avoidance Hypothesis

Animals select sleeping sites specifically to minimize predation risk.

**Key Factors**:
- **Physical protection**: Steep cliffs, dense vegetation, burrows, tree cavities
- **Concealment**: Hidden spots that reduce detection probability
- **Escape routes**: Sites with quick escape pathways
- **Remote locations**: Larger groups seek more isolated sleeping areas
- **Regular site switching**: Reduces predictability and parasite exposure

**Species Examples**:
- **Primates** (titi monkeys, moor macaques, baboons): Select sleeping sites based on predator avoidance, often choosing tall trees or cliff edges
- **Small birds**: Use hiding places rather than exposed branches
- **Deer**: Select bed sites with cover and visibility for escape

## Vigilance During Rest and Sleep-Vigilance Trade-offs

### Core Trade-off

Animals balance sleep needs with maintaining awareness of predators.

**Key Findings from Recent Research (2023-2025)**:
- **Increased predation risk** causes animals to shift to lighter, more vigilant sleep states
- **Sleep-related rise in sensory thresholds** creates vulnerability periods
- **Sleep restriction** occurs when predatory risk is elevated

### Vigilance Strategies

- **Lighter sleep states**: Reduced depth of sleep when threat perception is high
- **Sentinel behavior**: Coordinated vigilance where some individuals remain awake while others sleep
- **Synchronized vigilance**: Group members taking turns being alert
- **Asynchronous sleep patterns**: Not all group members sleep simultaneously

**Recent Evidence**:
- **Baboons** must navigate trade-offs between sleep investment and anti-predator vigilance
- **Chimpanzees** show sleep varies with social context and rank
- **Wild boar** sleep patterns are influenced by environmental conditions and individual factors

## Social Sleeping and Anti-Predator Benefits

### Key Benefits of Group Sleeping

- **Predator dilution effect**: Individual risk decreases as group size increases
- **Increased vigilance**: More eyes watching for threats
- **Shared sentinel duties**: Group members take turns being alert
- **Enhanced detection**: Early warning systems through multiple observers

### Costs

- **Sleep disruption**: Sharing sleeping sites can reduce sleep quality
- **Social interference**: Increased sleep disturbance from group members
- **Reduced sleep may be the price** for lower predation risk

**Research Findings (2024)**:
- Larger groups often choose safer but more remote sleeping sites
- Group sleeping provides anti-predator benefits despite sleep disruption costs
- Social status influences sleep: dominant individuals often have priority choice of safer sleeping positions

## Sleep Postures

### Birds

- **Head tucked back**: Bill tucked into back/scapular feathers (near-universal posture)
  - Benefits: Heat conservation, neck muscle rest, lower energy consumption
  - Trade-off: Reduced alertness increases predation risk
- **Bill forward position**: Alternative posture
- **Standing on one leg**: Common in many species
- **Under wing tucking**: Some species for additional protection

### Mammals

- **Cats**: Various positions indicating vigilance levels
  - Loaf/Sphinx pose: Alert resting
  - Curled up: Protective position
  - Side sleeping: Deep sleep
  - **Lateralized sleeping**: Two-thirds prefer leftward position for right brain hemisphere vigilance
- **Cattle**: Can sleep while ruminating
- **Many mammals**: Sleep with eyes semi-open for vigilance

**Posture Functions**:
- **Thermoregulation**: Heat conservation
- **Protection from predators**: Defensive positioning
- **Parasite avoidance**: Reducing exposure
- **Vigilance maintenance**: Alert-ready positions

## REM vs Non-REM Sleep Variation

**Both Groups Exhibit Two-State Sleep**:
- **REM (Rapid Eye Movement)** sleep
- **NREM/Non-REM** (Slow Wave Sleep)

**Key Differences**:

**Mammals**:
- Average **18% of total sleep time** is REM
- REM duration varies widely across species
- Influenced by body size, maturity at birth, predation risk
- Highest REM early in life, then decreases

**Birds**:
- **Significantly less REM sleep** than most mammals
- Despite being small and immature at birth (factors that predict more REM in mammals)
- REM primarily driven by circadian rhythm
- Also highest early in life

## Unihemispheric Slow-Wave Sleep (USWS)

### Definition

One brain hemisphere sleeps while the other remains awake and alert.

### Species Exhibiting USWS

**Marine Mammals**:
- **Dolphins and whales** (cetaceans): Can maintain health and memory with USWS
- **Fur seals and sea lions** (otariids): Can sleep unihemispherically while swimming
- **Manatees**
- **Walruses**: Can enter very deep sleep up to 19 hours on land; sleep during breath-holds underwater
- **True seals**: Sleep during breath-holds underwater, wake to breathe

**Birds**:
- USWS is **widespread among birds** (unlike mammals where it's rarer)
- May also occur in some reptiles

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Eye asymmetry**: Opposite eye often stays open when hemisphere sleeps
- **Duration**: Up to two hours before switching hemispheres
- **EEG patterns**: Slow-wave activity in one hemisphere, wakefulness in other
- **Can last extended periods** in aquatic environments

**Functional Benefits**:
1. **Breathing control**: Surface to breathe while sleeping
2. **Vigilance**: Maintain awareness of predators
3. **Thermoregulation**: Maintain body temperature
4. **Migration**: Rest during long flights while maintaining navigation
5. **Continuous swimming**: Remain mobile while asleep

## Sleep Duration Variation by Species

**Extreme Variation Documented**:
- **Range**: 3 hours (donkeys) to 20 hours (armadillos) daily in mammals
- **Birds**: Sleep on average 40% less than mammals
- **Mammals**: Average 40% longer sleep duration than birds

**Specific Examples**:
- **Koalas**: 18-22 hours/day
- **Sloths**: 10-20 hours/day
- **Chicken**: 11.7 hours (48.8% of day)
- **Jaguar**: 10.8 hours (45% of day)
- **Duck**: 10.8 hours (45% of day)
- **Dog**: 10.6 hours (44.3% of day)
- **Northern elephant seals**: 2 hours/day (at sea)

**Influencing Factors**:
- Age, body size, environment, diet
- Safety of sleep site
- Predation risk
- Trophic level (prey species often sleep less)
- Foraging requirements

## Safety Strategies During Sleep

1. **Temporal Avoidance**: Sleep when predators are less active
2. **Spatial Avoidance**: Choose inaccessible or concealed locations
3. **Group Defense**: Sleep in groups for dilution effect
4. **Vigilance Maintenance**: Light sleep, sentinels, asynchronous sleep
5. **Rapid Awakening**: Ability to wake quickly to threats
6. **Unihemispheric Sleep**: Maintain partial awareness
7. **Postural Adaptations**: Positions that allow quick escape
8. **Site Switching**: Reduce predictability

## Species-Specific Examples

### Cats

- Prefer leftward sleeping position (2/3 of cats) for right hemisphere vigilance
- Multiple sleep postures indicating different vigilance levels
- Balance between comfort and environmental awareness

### Dogs

- 10.6 hours average sleep
- Sleep postures vary with safety perception
- Can sleep with eyes semi-open

### Deer

- Select bed sites based on predator avoidance
- Use hiding as primary counter-strategy
- Alternate between slow-wave and REM sleep
- Both aggressive defense and flight tactics

### Rodents

- Most are nocturnal
- Anti-predator behaviors become more complex with age
- Use burrows and concealed locations
- High vigilance during rest periods

### Birds

- Head-tucking trade-off: energy conservation vs. safety
- Migratory birds in poor condition use head-tucking more (higher risk)
- Flocking provides collective vigilance
- Many species use unihemispheric sleep during migration

- **Rabbits**: Crepuscular activity peaks
- **Bats**: Nocturnal, sleep during day (already implemented)
- **Chickens**: Diurnal, roost at night

**Behavior improvements**:
- Animals choose covered/hidden spots for sleeping
- Group animals sleep together with sentinels
- Different sleep postures (alert rest vs. deep sleep)
- Quick awakening response to nearby threats
- Herd animals rotate sentinel duty

### Code Structure Suggestion

```java
public class SleepingBehavior {
    private final ActivityCycle cycle;
    private final int sleepStart;
    private final int sleepEnd;

    public boolean shouldSleep(AnimalEntity animal) {
        long dayTime = animal.level().getDayTime() % 24000;

        // Check activity cycle
        switch (cycle) {
            case DIURNAL:

        }
        return false;
    }

    public BlockPos findSleepSite(AnimalEntity animal) {
        // Look for covered, hidden locations
        // Prefer: under trees, in caves, under leaves
        // Avoid: open areas, near hostile mobs
        return findSafestNearbyPosition(animal, 16);
    }
}

public enum ActivityCycle {
    DIURNAL,    // Active day, sleep night (cows, sheep, chickens)
    NOCTURNAL,  // Active night, sleep day (wolves, ocelots, bats)
    CREPUSCULAR // Active dawn/dusk (rabbits, foxes)
}
```
