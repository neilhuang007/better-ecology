ONE BLD[IC RT R TIME!
The primary principle is that all actions interact with one block
at a time. You break one block, pull one lever, and till one
block of dirt. There should not be any copy-paste functionality,
building templates, or similar convenience tools. Interacting
with a block may impact multitudes of other blocks of course,
such as planting a tree, blowing up a TNT, or activating a
network of redstone, but from the player's perspective, it's all
starts with that singular interaction.
Why is this important? It allows us to maintain the interaction
model of Minecraft, but it also sets an essential constraint to
how you build things with other players. I want a player to
understand what is happening when they see someone else
play. Instantaneously placing buildings with templates would
make it hard for an observer to assist.

NOT DUITE RN RPli
Since Minecraft's original inspiration came from games such
as Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Master, it has evolved in the
direction of a fantasy role-playing game. But Minecraft is
not quite a traditional role-playing game, and a significant
distinction is that the player character doesn't develop skills
over time. The only thing that defines what a player can do are
the items they carry and their knowledge of the game.
One common misunderstanding stems from the levels that
players are awarded when defeating monsters or trading with
villagers. These are not experience levels in the traditional
sense of games, but rather enchanting levels that players can
use to improve their equipment.

BRO THIHli5 HRPPEH •••
... but it's tec:.rn1cally the players' fault. Disaster is common
in Minecraft, be it falling in lava or having your house blown
to pieces by a creeper The point is that these accidents
happened when there were players there to see them
happen. Avoid ng such dangers is done by playing differently
and more carefully. The game should not create situations that
are impossible to avoid, and when it does, they should have a
reasonably small impact.
Making sure the player is treated fairly is one reason why the
worst natural disaster is a (relatively tame) lightning strike, and
the list of blocks the endermen take is limited to natural-and
plentiful-blocks such as dirt and stone. If a game mechanic is
going to destroy hours of players' hard work, players should
be the ones initiating it, and players should be able to stop, or
even prevent it entirely.
One practical example is how iron golems ignore creepers,
because otherwise the creeper would explode and destroy
buildings without any player interaction.

"Different" is more interesting than "better," and that is true for

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
ITEMS SHOULD BE
MULTI-PURPOSE
The players' inventories are already quite over-encumbered
with the hundreds of items that exist in Minecraft. When we
add even more to the pool, we should think hard if we can
make them multi-purpose or have a broader use-case.
For example, the totem of undying only has a single use,
but ifs one with sufficient game play impact. Sometimes the
solution is another potion-brewing ingredient, but often the
best option is to provide a decoration block for players to craft.

THE WORLD
When we added the villages in the Minecraft beta, we made a
conscious decision that they wouldn't develop automatically.
The villagers would not build houses, and there would not be
any mechanics for adding more template-based buildings.
If the village needs a protective wall, the players will need to
construct 1t for them.
Minecraft offers a setting for players to interact with, but the
players decide what, when, and where that happens.

¥DURRE NOT
WERRINli R HUD
As far as possible we should try to describe what happens
using objects in the game world, and not rely on text messages
or a heads-up display. Good examples of items that show
information in an in-world sense are the map, compass, and
clock. Avoiding UI and text messages can be a real interaction
design challenge.
I'm personally also an opponent of the "F3 debug screen."
I don't want players to know or care about game engine
components such as coordinates, block states, or light levels.
If these are important to play the game, we need to design
in-character tools to deal with them.

THEM 15 NOT
If the Minecraft world is infinite, you can be pretty sure that
everything that can exist, does exist, but the question is how to
find what you want. It can be very frustrating to randomly walk
around looking for the most recent feature update. We want
to surprise our players and reward them for exploring, but we
should also make sure that we give players a reasonable way
of finding things. Exploration maps to the woodland mansion,
the eye of ender, and the bubble columns leading to under-
water ruins are a few examples of how this can be achieved.

5HDULD BE FRIENDLY
Animals in Minecraft should be friendly, or neutral at worst.
Letting animals remain friendly 1s partly done in favour of the
"ugly cute" direction, but also to enable them for players in
the peaceful difficulty setting.
Some animals can still defend themselves, like wolves and
polar bears, but real dangers are reserved for the nocturnal
monsters.

HOSTILE MOBS
SHOULD BE UNIDUE
We have the opportunity to create an entirely new mythology,
and we should make good use of it. When designing a hostile
monster, look beyond traditional fantasy beasts like minotaurs
and unicorns, and push for something unique.
The undead serve a purpose in the sense that they give
players a reference enemy they can compare other monsters
with. The iconic dragon is one of the more traditional things
that Notch wanted to add. We can try many other things as we
go forward.

MDB5 NEED
PER5DNRLIT't
It's important we catch the essence of the personality a mob
has, regardless if it's a hostile monster or a friendly animal. The
visuals, the sounds, and the Al behaviors all add to how players
relate to these creatures.
The most straightforward starting point is to make sure they
have eyes and that they look at the players when they are
nearby. Sound effects also help a lot but beyond that, each
mob should find at least one behavior that makes it stand out.
Llamas spitting, shulkers peeking out, and ocelots sneaking
up on chickens are a few examples.

Steve and Alex are placeholders for players, and there are no
other human characters in Minecraft. Only human beings (the
players) may look like humans.
There are a few exceptions: in Minecraft: Education Edition
we added more villager skins to help with tutorial NPCs, and
in Minecraft: Story Mode, the concept is that all characters are
"players on a server."

ND ITEM 15
TRULY UNIDUE
Tying back to the concept of the multiverse, we should avoid
having unique items and characters. Of course, each world
and player experience is unique but adding named weapons,
such as a crossbow called "Heartseeker" would add connection
points between worlds that would make them feel less
special. This would go against the multiverse idea, where all
possibilities exist at once.

There are many weird and strange things in Minecraft. They
often don't make a lot of sense, but it's not our job to explain
them. Why are there monsters at night? What are the ii lagers?
Who built the stronghold? Such questions can be the starting
point of a story, and even if we have our own idea, we should
keep it to ourselves.

With all creatures and monsters we add, we should assume
they are genderless or of unknown gender. In some languages,
this is very hard to achieve, but in English, we should avoid
using words such as "brethren," "king," or "dutchess."
Player characters represent individuals and can obviously
be "he" or "she." In these cases our objective is to make sure
these are portrayed with equal ability and purpose.

We should always design things with Hardcore difficulty in
mind. Death and demise are real, and gameplay mechanics
should not rely on respawn. As an example, it was once
suggested to have an achievement for dying spectacularly,
but since this 1s not possible to achieve in Hardcore without
ending a run, it was turned down.

Ouin<s and glitches are often fun and charming, but we should
not rely on undefined behaviour. It's easy to accidentally "fix"
something players depend on if they're not implemented as
ifltert1onal features.
With this in mind, we fixed the booster tracks and replaced
them with powered rails. We removed the negative durability
bug and replaced 1t w,th an "unbreakable" item tag.

We neec to remember that Minecraft is a game. It's about
breaking and plac ng blocks, ~:nding treasure, hoarding items,
and defedt1ng the nightly .,-,onsters. You turn to creative mode
to build things with fnends and have a good time. Along
with the "one block at a time," we should not let game rules,
command blorks, or configuration pages take away from the
core of what people want from Minecraft.
That said, don't be surprised 1f it features an "Editor Mode" in
the future. We are mo king a game, but the community is also
creating experiences for other players, and we enable those
where possible.
